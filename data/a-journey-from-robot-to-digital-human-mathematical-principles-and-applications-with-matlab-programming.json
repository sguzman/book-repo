{"categories":["Engineering","Programming","Robotics","Software"],"desc":"This book provides readers with a solid set of diversified and essential tools for the theoretical modeling and control of complex robotic systems, as well as for digital human modeling and realistic motion generation. Following a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of robotic kinematics, dynamics and control systems design, the author extends robotic modeling procedures and motion algorithms to a much higher-dimensional, larger scale and more sophisticated research area, namely digital human modeling. Most of the methods are illustrated by MATLAB™ codes and sample graphical visualizations, offering a unique closed loop between conceptual understanding and visualization. Readers are guided through practicing and creating 3D graphics for robot arms as well as digital human models in MATLAB™, and through driving them for real-time animation. This work is intended to serve as a robotics textbook with an extension to digital human modeling for senior undergraduate and graduate engineering students. At the same time, it represents a comprehensive reference guide for all researchers, scientists and professionals eager to learn the fundamentals of robotic systems as well as the basic methods of digital human modeling and motion generation.","details":{"authors":"Edward Y L Gu","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3642390463","isbn-13":"978-3642390463","pages":"585 pages","publication date":"July 25, 2013","publisher":"Springer","size":"17.07Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/ba/bae5fad880e68030496404f1eb1435ef.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/am2","title":"A Journey from Robot to Digital Human: Mathematical Principles and Applications with MATLAB Programming"}
