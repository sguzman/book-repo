{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" This is a first-rate introductory book that takes a practical approach to solving problems using C++. It covers a much wider scope of C++ programming than other introductory books Ive seen, and in a surprisingly compact format. – Dag Bruck, founding member of the ANSI/ISO C++ committee The authors present a clear, cogent introduction to C++ programming in a way that gets the student writing nontrivial programs immediately. – Stephen Clamage, Sun Microsystems, Inc., and chair of the ANSI C++ committee Anyone reading just this one book and working through the examples and exercises will have the same skills as many professional programmers. – Jeffrey D. Oldham, Stanford University Why is Accelerated C++ so effective? Because it: *Starts with the most useful concepts rather than the most primitive ones: You can begin writing programs immediately. *Describes real problems and solutions, not just language features: You see not only what each feature is, but also how to use it. * Covers the language and standard library together: You can use the library right from the start. The authors proved this approach in their professional-education course at Stanford University, where student","details":{"authors":"Andrew Koenig, Barbara E.
