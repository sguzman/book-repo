Through a series of self-paced lessons (each of which builds on the last and includes hands-on projects that the reader can create using the files on the CD-ROM), this guide acquaints users with all of Acrobat’s regular and industrial-strength features for creating, reviewing, editing, commenting on, modifying, and preflighting PDF files. Readers who are already familiar with the basics of using Acrobat will get up to speed on significantly overhauled new features available in Acrobat 9.","details":{"authors":"Adobe Creative Team","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0321552970","isbn-13":"978-0321552976","pages":"368 pages","publication date":"August 21, 2008","publisher":"Adobe Press","size":"30.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/f0/f01d81bd7e002f96ff5f0a90b65fbecd.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bk0","title":"Adobe Acrobat 9 Classroom in a Book"}
