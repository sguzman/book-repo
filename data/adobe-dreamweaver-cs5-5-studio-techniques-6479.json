{"categories":["Designing","Mobile Development","Programming","Software","Web Development"],"desc":" Itâ€™s widely predicted that mobile phones and tablets will overtake desktop PCs as the most common Web access devices within the next two or three years. Adobe is responding to this dramatic shift by focusing on new tools to develop websites for multiple platforms with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Dreamweaver CS5.5. In particular, Dreamweaver engineers have been working closely with the developers of jQuery, the de-facto standard JavaScript framework, to develop jQuery Mobile. This is a new JavaScript/CSS framework designed to create websites and applications that work consistently in all major mobile platforms, including iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, and Symbian (Nokia). This book explores in depth the integration of jQuery Mobile in Dreamweaver, together with other new features aimed at building websites that work across multiple devices.","details":{"authors":"David Powers","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"032177325X","isbn-13":"978-0321773258","pages":"288 pages","publication date":"June 25, 2011","publisher":"Adobe Press","size":"8.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/8d/8d5b6b8e7cfdd3c8b3ca7d15ebf2aa58.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/g82","title":"Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5 Studio Techniques: Designing and Developing for Mobile with jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3"}
