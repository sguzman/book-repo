Using step-by-step instructions with projects that build on the knowledge acquired in each lesson, readers will learn about the new PHP features in Dreamweaver CS5, including the ability to work in Live View with WordPress, as well as extended support for PHP code hints, syntax checking, and dynamically related files. Readers will learn how to upload images and send email with attachments using the Zend Framework. In contrast to existing books on the Zend Framework, this book will show web designers and developers with little or no programming experience how to use selected modules to integrate dynamic features into existing sites. There is a strong emphasis on following security best practices. Readers will also learn progressive enhancement techniques for updating pages seamlessly with PHP and Ajax.","details":{"authors":"David Powers","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0321719840","isbn-13":"978-0321719843","pages":"504 pages","publication date":"August 20, 2010","publisher":"Adobe Press","size":"15.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/fb/fb48af19126e4fb2bd57e509720eb492.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8a1","title":"Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 with PHP: Training from the Source"}
