{"categories":["Designing","Engineering"],"desc":" X-by-wire Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) have been attracting increased attention for various civilian or military applications. The x-by-wire techniques (drive-by-wire, steer-by-wire, and brake-by-wire techniques) provide the possibility of achieving novel vehicle design and advanced dynamics control, which can significantly improve the overall performance, maneuverability, and mobility of the UGVs. However, there are few full x-by-wire UGVs prototype models reported in the world. Therefore, there is no book that can fully describe the design, configuration, and dynamics control approach of full x-by-wire UGVs, which makes it difficult for readers to study this hot and interesting topic. In this book, we use a full x-by-wire UGV, developed by our group, as the example. This UGV is completely x-by-wire with four in-wheel motors driven and a four-wheel independent steer steer. In this book, the overall design of the UGV, the design of the key subsystems (battery pack system, in-wheel motor-driven system, independent steer system, remote and autonomous control system), and the dynamics control approach will be introduced in detail, and the experimentâ€™s results will be provided to validate the proposed dynamics control approach.","details":{"authors":"Jun NI, Jibin Hu, Changle Xiang","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1681732513","isbn-13":"978-1681732510","pages":"144 pages","publication date":"January 4, 2018","publisher":"Morgan & Claypool Publishers","size":"9.24Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/f0/f069cff5e8fc8c4f2282d483c16258b1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/chv","title":"Design and Advanced Robust Chassis Dynamics Control for X-by-Wire Unmanned Ground Vehicle (Synthesis Lectures on Advances in Automotive Technology)"}
