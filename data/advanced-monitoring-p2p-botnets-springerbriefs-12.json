{"categories":["Engineering","Networking","Security","Web Development"],"desc":" This book presents current research in the area of advanced monitoring in P2P botnets, and uses a dual-perspective approach to discuss aspects of botnet monitoring in-depth. First, from the perspective of a defender, e.g. researchers, it introduces advanced approaches to successfully monitor botnets, taking the presence of current botnet anti-monitoring mechanisms into consideration. Then, adopting a botmaster perspective to anticipate the advances in future botnets, it introduces advanced measures to detect and prevent monitoring activities. All the proposed methods were evaluated either using real-world data or in a simulation scenario. In addition to providing readers with an in-depth understanding of P2P botnets, the book also analyzes the implications of the various design choices of recent botnets for effectively monitoring them. It serves as an excellent introduction to new researchers and provides a useful review for specialists in the field.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9811090491","isbn-13":"978-9811090493","pages":"105 pages","publication date":"July 16, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"2.77Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/e5/e5cb568f134db7190d1ac06d31124690.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/hbp","title":"Advanced Monitoring in P2P Botnets: A Dual Perspective (SpringerBriefs on Cyber Security Systems and Networks)"}
