{"categories":["Digital Design/Media","Game Development","Programming"],"desc":" Advanced 3D Game Programming with DirectX 10.0 provides a guide to developing cutting-edge games using DirectX 10.0. Beginning with the foundations of 3D math and the components of DirectX, programmers new to graphics and game programming will learn how to implement networking, collision detection, and multithreading. Full source code is provided for the examples and for the client/server networked 3D first-person game that brings together many of the techniques discussed in the book. Learn how to acquire input from the user through the keyboard and mouse; simulate intelligence using steering algorithms and motivation engines; render using HLSL shaders; use advanced 3D techniques such as forward and inverse kinematics, subdivision surfaces, and radiosity lighting; manage scenes via portal rendering.","details":{"authors":"Peter Walsh","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1598220543","isbn-13":"978-1598220544","pages":"530 pages","publication date":"January 8, 2008","publisher":"Jones & Bartlett Learning","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/3b/3b156162c442fd36e3f4d2e62e560578.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/7t2","title":"Advanced 3D Game Programming With Directx 10.0 (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)"}
