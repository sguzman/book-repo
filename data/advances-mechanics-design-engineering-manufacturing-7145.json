{"categories":["Designing","Engineering"],"desc":" This book gathers papers presented at the International Joint Conference on Mechanics, Design Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing (JCM 2016), held on 14-16 September, 2016, in Catania, Italy. It reports on cutting-edge topics in product design and manufacturing, such as industrial methods for integrated product and process design; innovative design; and computer-aided design. Further topics covered include virtual simulation and reverse engineering; additive manufacturing; product manufacturing; engineering methods in medicine and education; representation techniques; and nautical, aeronautics and aerospace design and modeling. The book is divided into eight main sections, reflecting the focus and primary themes of the conference. The contributions presented here will not only provide researchers, engineers and experts in a range of industrial engineering subfields with extensive information to support their daily work; they are also intended to stimulate new research directions, advanced applications of the methods discussed, and future interdisciplinary collaborations.","details":{"authors":"Benoit Eynard, Vincenzo Nigrelli, Salvatore Massimo Oliveri, Guillermo Peris-Fajarnes, Sergio Rizzuti","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319457802","isbn-13":"978-3319457802","pages":"1245 pages","publication date":"November 11, 2016","publisher":"Springer","size":"95.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/cf/cf8d56a8510b408320505d59b83b1085.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ff6","title":"Advances on Mechanics, Design Engineering and Manufacturing: Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Mechanics, Design Engineering & â€¦ (Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering)"}
