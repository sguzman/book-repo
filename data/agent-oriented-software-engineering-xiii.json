{"categories":["Engineering","Uncategorized"],"desc":"This book constitutes the thoroughly refereed post-proceedings of the 13th Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) workshop, held at the 11th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, AAMAS 2012, in Valencia, Spain, in June 2012. This volume presents 9 thoroughly revised papers selected from 24 submissions as well as two invited articles by leading researchers in the field. The papers cover a broad range of topics related to software engineering of agent-based systems, with particular attention to the integration of concepts and techniques from multi-agent systems with recent programming languages, platforms, and established software engineering methodologies.","details":{"authors":"Jörg Müller, Massimo Cossentino","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3642398650","isbn-13":"978-3642398650","pages":"197 pages","publication date":"July 25, 2013","publisher":"Springer","size":"5.46Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/7b/7b2e6c6adcf8409706444ba48bf2fabb.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/eit","title":"Agent-Oriented Software Engineering XIII"}
