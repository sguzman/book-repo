{"categories":["Computing","Engineering"],"desc":" Arising from a special session held at the 2010 North American Annual Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, this volume is an international cross-disciplinary collaboration with contributions from leading experts exploring connections across their respective fields. Themes range from philosophical examination of the foundations of physics and quantum logic, to exploitations of the methods and structures of operator theory, category theory, and knot theory in an effort to gain insight into the fundamental questions in quantum theory and logic. The book will appeal to researchers and students working in related fields, including logicians, mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists. A brief introduction provides essential background on quantum mechanics and category theory, which, together with a thematic selection of articles, may also serve as the basic material for a graduate course or seminar.","details":{"authors":"Jennifer Chubb, Ali Eskandarian, Valentina Harizanov","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"110703339X","isbn-13":"978-1107033399","pages":"356 pages","publication date":"February 26, 2016","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/1e/1e75dbee117b1b0c02d2c5489fb5843c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ake","title":"Logic and Algebraic Structures in Quantum Computing (Lecture Notes in Logic)"}
