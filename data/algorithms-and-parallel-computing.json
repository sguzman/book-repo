{"categories":["Algorithms","Computing","Programming"],"desc":" There is a software gap between the hardware potential and the performance that can be attained using todayâ€™s software parallel program development tools. The tools need manual intervention by the programmer to parallelize the code. Programming a parallel computer requires closely studying the target algorithm or application, more so than in the traditional sequential programming we have all learned. The programmer must be aware of the communication and data dependencies of the algorithm or application. This book provides the techniques to explore the possible ways to program a parallel computer for a given application.","details":{"authors":"Fayez Gebali","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0470902108","isbn-13":"978-0470902103","pages":"364 pages","publication date":"April 19, 2011","publisher":"Wiley","size":"7.64Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/61/6176b13494d828b540919afd5d9054a2.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9hu","title":"Algorithms and Parallel Computing"}
