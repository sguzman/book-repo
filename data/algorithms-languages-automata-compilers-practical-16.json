{"categories":["Algorithms","Programming"],"desc":" Algorithms, Languages, Automata, & Compilers A Practical Approach is designed to cover the standard “theory of computing” topics through a strong emphasis on practical applications rather than theorems and proofs. Finite automata, Turing machines, models of computation, complexity, solvability, and other topics that form a foundation of modern programming are discussed -first with a gentle theoretical orientation, and then applied through programming code and practical examples. JFLAP projects and applications are integrated throughout the book, and C# is used for all code.","details":{"authors":"Maxim Mozgovoy","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0763776270","isbn-13":"978-0763776275","pages":"345 pages","publication date":"August 19, 2009","publisher":"Jones & Bartlett Learning","size":"10.43Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/fd/fd815cc01bf71b52e510675a1c75be2a.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h0a","title":"Algorithms, Languages, Automata, And Compilers: A Practical Approach"}
