{"categories":["Algorithms","Data Management","Engineering"],"desc":" This volume provides approaches and solutions to challenges occurring at the interface of research fields such as, e.g., data analysis, data mining and knowledge discovery, computer science, operations research, and statistics. In addition to theory-oriented contributions various application areas are included. Moreover, traditional classification research directions concerning network data, graphs, and social relationships as well as statistical musicology describe examples for current interest fields tackled by the authors. The book comprises a total of 55 selected papers presented at the Joint Conference of the German Classification Society (GfKl), the German Association for Pattern Recognition (DAGM), and the Symposium of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) in 2011.​","details":{"authors":"Berthold Lausen, Dirk Van den Poel, Alfred Ultsch","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319000349","isbn-13":"978-3319000343","pages":"547 pages","publication date":"August 28, 2013","publisher":"Springer","size":"8.24Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/a6/a66ba22022e0f16ad21e713ae119c9e5.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/98b","title":"Algorithms from and for Nature and Life: Classification and Data Analysis (Studies in Classification, Data Analysis, and Knowledge Organization)"}
