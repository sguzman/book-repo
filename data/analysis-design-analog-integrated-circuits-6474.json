{"categories":["Designing","Engineering","Hardware"],"desc":" The fifth edition retains its completeness, updates the coverage of bipolar technologies, and enhances the discussion of bicmos. It provides a more unified treatment of digital and analog circuit design while strengthening the coverage of cmos. The chapter on non-linear analog circuits has been removed and chapter 11 has been updated to include an operational amplifier example.
