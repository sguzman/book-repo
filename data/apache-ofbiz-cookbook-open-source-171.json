{"categories":["Manual","Programming"],"desc":" The best way to experience OFBiz is to dive right in and start “kicking the tires”. No matter if you are an end user exploring the out-of-the-box e-commerce web store or a software developer getting ready to build a new application, you will find, eventually, that you perform the same tasks over and over again. This book is designed as a reference to guide you through those oft encountered OFBiz tasks. It is a collection of recipes, not necessarily in any particular order of importance, that address and give answer to many of the very real world questions asked about how to do things with OFBiz. If you are an OFBiz user who has some familiarity with enterprise software systems, and perhaps more importantly, Internet and Web exposure, you will be able to glean useful information from this book. For following some recipes you will need only basic knowledge of modern browser behavior (for example: how to click a mouse button) while others assume only a passing familiarity with a text-editor and XML documents. If you are a software developer looking for Java and/or Groovy examples, this book also includes a chapter on Java software development.","details":{"authors":"Ruth Hoffman","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847199186","isbn-13":"978-1847199188","pages":"300 pages","publication date":"September 7, 2010","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"5.91Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/27/27aa2b5ddf5491128fd07e21ad1f2d26.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dvw","title":"Apache OFBiz Cookbook (Open Source: Community Experience Distilled)"}
