{"categories":["Software"],"desc":" The book consists of a set of business scenarios and corresponding solution critiques. Each “use case” chapter is made up of a problem description, assessment of implementation options, and the selection of the ideal solution candidate. We then construct the solution using the chosen Microsoft technology. This book is for architects, developers, and managers who need to improve their knowledge of the Microsoft application platform. This book will appeal to anyone who wants to get up to speed on selecting the most appropriate platform for a particular problem. Consultants and executive leadership will also find significant value in this book. A good understanding of the general Windows platform and development technologies would be helpful.","details":{"authors":"Ewan Fairweather, Stephen W.
