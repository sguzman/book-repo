{"categories":["Computer Science","Engineering"],"desc":" This book provides an introduction to logic and mathematical induction which are the basis of any deductive computational framework. A strong mathematical foundation of the logical engines available in modern proof assistants, such as the PVS verification system, is essential for computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers to increment their capabilities to provide formal proofs of theorems and to certify the robustness of software and hardware systems.
