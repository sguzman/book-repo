{"categories":["Machine Learning"],"desc":" This book provides a hybrid approach to fault detection and diagnostics. It presents a detailed analysis related to practical applications of the fault detection and diagnostics framework, and highlights recent ﬁndings on power plant nonlinear model identiﬁcation and fault diagnostics. The eﬀectiveness of the methods presented is tested using data acquired from actual cogeneration and cooling plants (CCPs). The models presented were developed by applying Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) methods. The book offers a valuable resource for researchers and practicing engineers alike.","details":{"authors":"Tamiru Alemu Lemma","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"331971869X","isbn-13":"978-3319718699","pages":"283 pages","publication date":"December 31, 2017","publisher":"Springer","size":"13.81Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/63/63cf70df3034dadfe671ea08d7a8a8b4.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/d3r","title":"A Hybrid Approach for Power Plant Fault Diagnostics (Studies in Computational Intelligence)"}
