{"categories":["Mobile Development","Programming","Web Development"],"desc":" Aptana RadRails is an Integrated Development Environment for Ruby on Rails projects. Built on top of the well-known Eclipse platform, RadRails provides all the tools you need to create a whole Rails application from a single interface, allowing you to focus on the creative part of the development as your IDE takes care of the mechanics. This book is for Ruby on Rails developers who want to make the most of the framework by using an Integrated Development Environment. Even though the book explains everything you need to follow the contents, the focus is on how to use the tool and not on the Rails framework itself, so previous working knowledge of Rails is highly advisable. Previous knowledge of Eclipse is not necessary.","details":{"authors":"Javier Ramirez","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847193986","isbn-13":"978-1847193988","pages":"233 pages","publication date":"May 23, 2008","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"4.66Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b9/b9c5e3c55ccd25681d05d622efd0906c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/gvc","title":"Aptana RadRails: An IDE for Rails Development: A comprehensive guide to using RadRails to develop your Ruby on Rails projects in a professional and productive manner"}
