Alex’s teaching background really rings through as every item is nicely structured and very informative.  Overall Alex’s  book is a winner. Well structured, illustrated and most of all easy to read and understand. While the overall theme is based in architecture, the techniques can be applied to any discipline and the wide range of topics covered are excellently delivered.”","details":{"authors":"Alexander C.
