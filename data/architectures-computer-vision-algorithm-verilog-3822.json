{"categories":["Algorithms","Engineering","Machine Learning"],"desc":" This book provides comprehensive coverage of 3D vision systems, from vision models and state-of-the-art algorithms to their hardware architectures for implementation on DSPs, FPGA and ASIC chips, and GPUs. It aims to fill the gaps between computer vision algorithms and real-time digital circuit implementations, especially with Verilog HDL design. The organization of this book is vision and hardware module directed, based on Verilog vision modules, 3D vision modules, parallel vision architectures, and Verilog designs for the stereo matching system with various parallel architectures.
