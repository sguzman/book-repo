{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" Modern Computer Arithmetic focuses on arbitrary-precision algorithms for efficiently performing arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication and division, and their connections to topics such as modular arithmetic, greatest common divisors, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and the computation of elementary and special functions. Brent and Zimmermann present algorithms that are ready to implement in your favorite language, while keeping a high-level description and avoiding too low-level or machine-dependent details. The book is intended for anyone interested in the design and implementation of efficient high-precision algorithms for computer arithmetic, and more generally efficient multiple-precision numerical algorithms. It may also be used in a graduate course in mathematics or computer science, for which exercises are included. These vary considerably in difficulty, from easy to small research projects, and expand on topics discussed in the text. Solutions are available from the authors.","details":{"authors":"Richard P.
