{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" Real-world information is imperfect and is usually described in natural language (NL). Moreover, this information is often partially reliable and a degree of reliability is also expressed in NL. In view of this, the concept of a Z-number is a more adequate concept for the description of real-world information. The main critical problem that naturally arises in processing Z-numbers-based information is the computation with Z-numbers. Nowadays, there is no arithmetic of Z-numbers suggested in existing literature.","details":{"authors":"Rafik A Aliev, Oleg H Huseynov, Rashad R Aliyev, Akif A Alizadeh","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9814675288","isbn-13":"978-9814675284","pages":"316 pages","publication date":"June 26, 2015","publisher":"World Scientific Publishing Co","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/21/2183e316051731cbe674223324f7b771.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9u9","title":"The Arithmetic of Z-Numbers: Theory and Applications"}
