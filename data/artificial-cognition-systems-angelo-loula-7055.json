{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" Artificial Cognition Systems presents recent research efforts in artificial intelligence about building artificial systems capable of performing cognitive tasks. Such study relies on modeling and simulating cognitive processes and therefore constructs experimental labs to evaluate hypothesis and theories about cognition.    Artificial Cognition Systems offers contributions from researchers with different backgrounds applying diverse perspectives in cognitive processes modeling and simulation, and brings forth an important and open discussion in artificial intelligence: how cognitive processes can be meaningful to artificial systems.","details":{"authors":"Angelo Loula, Ricardo Gudwin, Jo√£o Queiroz","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1599041111","isbn-13":"978-1599041117","pages":"402 pages","publication date":"July 13, 2006","publisher":"IGI Global","size":"7.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/81/81578bb73bff703eb043c13df55e8dd1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/f44","title":"Artificial Cognition Systems"}
