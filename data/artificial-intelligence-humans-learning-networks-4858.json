{"categories":["Machine Learning","Manual","Networking"],"desc":" Neural networks have been a mainstay of artificial intelligence since its earliest days.  Now, exciting new technologies such as deep learning and convolution are taking neural networks in bold new directions.  In this book, we will demonstrate the neural networks in a variety of real-world tasks such as image recognition and data science.  We examine current neural network technologies, including ReLU activation, stochastic gradient descent, cross-entropy, regularization, dropout, and visualization.","details":{"authors":"Jeff Heaton","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1505714346","isbn-13":"978-1505714340","pages":"374 pages","publication date":"October 28, 2015","publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","size":"8.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/e8/e86a40b7421770a9a1156b1b6192d86f.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/7ud","title":"Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Volume 3: Deep Learning and Neural Networks"}
