{"categories":["Machine Learning"],"desc":" Over the coming decades, Artificial Intelligence will profoundly impact the way we live, work, wage war, play, seek a mate, educate our young, and care for our elderly. It is likely to greatly increase our aggregate wealth, but it will also upend our labor markets, reshuffle our social order, and strain our private and public institutions. Eventually it may alter how we see our place in the universe, as machines pursue goals independent of their creators and outperform us in domains previously believed to be the sole dominion of humans. Whether we regard them as conscious or unwitting, revere them as a new form of life or dismiss them as mere clever appliances, is beside the point. They are likely to play an increasingly critical and intimate role in many aspects of our lives.","details":{"authors":"Jerry Kaplan","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0190602392","isbn-13":"978-0190602390","pages":"192 pages","publication date":"October 3, 2016","publisher":"Oxford University Press","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/f0/f0b3d9fdfb8e0dbe7dfbef2f46ee78fe.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9v0","title":"Artificial Intelligence: What Everyone Needs to Know"}
