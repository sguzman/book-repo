{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" How much more effective would companies be if all the content they created for the Web reached its specific target audience? In this book, three pioneering IBM content and search experts show how to get closer to this goal than ever before. Readers will discover how to write highly relevant content containing the keywords and long-tail phrases their targeted users actually use. By doing so, they will learn how to go beyond merely maximising traffic to actually delivering the right content to the right visitors at the right time. They will even learn how to prove the relevancy of their Web content. More than any other book, Audience, Relevance, and Search is relentlessly focused on the search and content optimisation problems that Web professionals face right now. Drawing on 45+ years of collective experience in Web publishing and search effectiveness, the authors share powerful insights into these and other crucial challenges.","details":{"authors":"James Mathewson, Frank Donatone, Cynthia Fishel","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0137004206","isbn-13":"978-0137004201","pages":"208 pages","publication date":"May 6, 2010","publisher":"IBM Press","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/4f/4f473561a8f05e9234b63cbcba533007.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/fxj","title":"Audience, Relevance, and Search: Targeting Web Audiences with Relevant Content"}
