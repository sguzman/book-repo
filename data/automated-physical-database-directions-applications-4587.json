{"categories":["Data Management","Databases","Designing","Engineering","Programming"],"desc":" Relational database systems have significantly evolved since their inception over 30 years ago. New applications are now more complex than ever and tuning a production system for performance has become a critical yet time-consuming activity. This book shows how to use automated systems for time-efficient database tuning. The author presents a detailed overview of the fundamental research that makes it possible to automatically recommend changes to the physical design of database systems. The bookÂ provides a comprehensive overview of the automated tuning tools that can be used to systematically explore the space of alternatives and to guide database administrators.","details":{"authors":"Nicolas Bruno","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1439815674","isbn-13":"978-1439815670","pages":"253 pages","publication date":"February 7, 2011","publisher":"CRC Press","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/e0/e07c85a4ec7f1c09673b28d715e8d79e.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8b5","title":"Automated Physical Database Design and Tuning (Emerging Directions in Database Systems and Applications)"}
