{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" Visual Basic 2010 offers a great deal of functionality in both tools and language. No one book could ever cover Visual Basic 2010 in its entirety—you would need a library of books. What this book aims to do is to get you started as quickly and easily as possible. It shows you the roadmap, so to speak, of what there is and where to go. Once we’ve taught you the basics of creating working applications (creating the windows and controls, how your code should handle unexpected events, what object-oriented programming is, how to use it in your applications, and so on) we’ll show you some of the areas you might want to try your hand at next.","details":{"authors":"Bryan Newsome","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0470502223","isbn-13":"978-0470502228","pages":"724 pages","publication date":"March 15, 2010","publisher":"Wrox","size":"40.02Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/d7/d7d2ffa0a76feaab821930e95daace93.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dr4","title":"Beginning Visual Basic 2010"}
