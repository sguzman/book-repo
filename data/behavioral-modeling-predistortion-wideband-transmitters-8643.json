{"categories":["Databases","Telecommunications"],"desc":" Covers theoretical and practical aspects related to the behavioral modelling and predistortion of wireless transmitters and power amplifiers. It includes simulation software that enables the users to apply the theory presented in the book. In the first section, the reader is given the general background of nonlinear dynamic systems along with their behavioral modelling from all its aspects. In the second part, a comprehensive compilation of behavioral models formulations and structures is provided including memory polynomial based models, box oriented models such as Hammerstein-based and Wiener-based models, and neural networks-based models. The book will be a valuable resource for design engineers, industrial engineers, applications engineers, postgraduate students, and researchers working on power amplifiers modelling, linearization, and design.","details":{"authors":"Fadhel M.
