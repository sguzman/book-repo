{"categories":["Big Data","Computer Science","Data Management","Databases","Engineering","Programming"],"desc":" This book presents a novel approach to database concepts, describing a categorical logic for database schema mapping based on views, within a framework for database integration/exchange and peer-to-peer. Database mappings, database programming languages, and denotational and operational semantics are discussed in depth. An analysis method is also developed that combines techniques from second order logic, data modeling, co-algebras and functorial categorial semantics. Features: provides an introduction to logics, co-algebras, databases, schema mappings and category theory; describes the core concepts of big data integration theory, with examples; examines the properties of the DB category; defines the categorial RDB machine; presents full operational semantics for database mappings; discusses matching and merging operators for databases, universal algebra considerations and algebraic lattices of the databases; explores the relationship of the database weak monoidal topos w.r.t. intuitionistic logic.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"331904155X","isbn-13":"978-3319041551","pages":"516 pages","publication date":"January 24, 2014","publisher":"Springer","size":"6.11Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/ff/ff1ef381a440b67f9a1a54f5bf8b87cb.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h8d","title":"Big Data Integration Theory: Theory and Methods of Database Mappings, Programming Languages, and Semantics (Texts in Computer Science)"}
