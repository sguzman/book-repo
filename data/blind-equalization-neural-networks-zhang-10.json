{"categories":["Machine Learning","Networking"],"desc":" The book begins with an introduction of blind equalization theory and its application in neural networks, then discusses the algorithms in recurrent networks, fuzzy networks and other frequently-studied neural networks. Each algorithm is accompanied by derivation, modeling and simulation, making the book an essential reference for electrical engineers, computer intelligence researchers and neural scientists.","details":{"authors":"Liyi Zhang","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3110449625","isbn-13":"978-3110449624","pages":"256 pages","publication date":"December 18, 2017","publisher":"De Gruyter","size":"5.83Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/0a/0a92ce7077c116abd588b25670cbf7da.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/d45","title":"Blind Equalization in Neural Networks"}
