{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" The arrival and popularity of multi-core processors has sparked a renewed interest in the development of parallel programs. Similarly, the availability of low-cost microprocessors and sensors has generated a great interest in embedded real-time programs. This book provides students and programmers whose backgrounds are in traditional sequential programming with the opportunity to expand their capabilities into parallel, embedded, real-time and distributed computing. It also addresses the theoretical foundation of real-time scheduling analysis, focusing on theory that is useful for actual applications. Written by award-winning educators at a level suitable for undergraduates and beginning graduate students, this book is the first truly entry-level textbook in the subject. Complete examples allow readers to understand the context in which a new concept is used, and enable them to build and run the examples, make changes, and observe the results.","details":{"authors":"Frank Singhoff, Jérôme Hugues","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521197163","isbn-13":"978-0521197168","pages":"388 pages","publication date":"May 16, 2011","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/f6/f696938d08437bde01d00de4e266a7d1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ah9","title":"Building Parallel, Embedded, and Real-Time Applications with Ada"}
