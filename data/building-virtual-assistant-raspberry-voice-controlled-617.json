{"categories":["Hardware","Programming"],"desc":" Build a voice-controlled virtual assistant using speech-to-text engines, text-to-speech engines, and conversation modules. This book shows you how to program the virtual assistant to gather data from the internet (weather data, data from Wikipedia, data mining); play music; and take notes. Each chapter covers building a mini project/module to make the virtual assistant better. Youâ€™ll develop the software on Linux or OS X before transferring it to your Raspberry Pi, ready for deploying in your own home-automation or Internet of Things applications.","details":{"authors":"Tanay Pant","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1484221664","isbn-13":"978-1484221662","pages":"95 pages","publication date":"July 28, 2016","publisher":"Apress","size":"5.87Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/e5/e55b9972d1d0ba0d12e284135de859b3.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bav","title":"Building a Virtual Assistant for Raspberry Pi: The practical guide for constructing a voice-controlled virtual assistant"}
