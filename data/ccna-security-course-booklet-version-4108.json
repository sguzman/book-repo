{"categories":["Networking","Security"],"desc":" The Cisco CCNA Security curriculum provides a comprehensive overview of contemporary network security, helping Cisco Networking Academy students systematically prepare for the latest CCNA Security exam. While extensive online study resources are available, many students and instructors have requested a low-cost printed resource that can be used to study in places where Internet access may not be available. This booklet is that resource. Drawn directly from the online curriculum, it covers every skill and competency. This booklet enables you to study offline, highlight key points, and take handwritten notes. Its text is extracted word-for-word from the online course, and headings with exact page correlations link to the online course for classroom discussions and exam preparation. In addition, a set of icons directs you to the online Cisco Networking Academcy curriculum to take full advantage of the images, labs, Packet Tracer activities, and dynamic Flash-based activities provided there.","details":{"authors":"Cisco Networking Academy","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1587132486","isbn-13":"978-1587132483","pages":"432 pages","publication date":"August 20, 2009","publisher":"Cisco Press","size":"17.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/73/73226fb6275cb80d6723fcef63a93477.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bqf","title":"CCNA Security Course Booklet, Version 1.0"}
