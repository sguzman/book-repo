{"categories":["Telecommunications"],"desc":" In this book, the author addresses technologies that are being used in emerging cellular markets. These include GSM/EGPRS and CDMA which are being deployed at a rapid pace, while technologies such as UMTS (3G)/ HSPA (3.5G) which have started to find a place in these high growth markets, are also considered. The book examines other technologies including LTE (3.9G) which have already moved out of research labs into the commercial world. 2G-CDMA is widely used, while further developments, e.g. CDMA2000 are also finding acceptance in the commercial arena. IMS/Convergence is increasingly popular all over the world; UMA, which is deployed mostly in North America; and DVB which is gaining worldwide popularity, especially in South Asia, are all reviewed.","details":{"authors":"Ajay R.
