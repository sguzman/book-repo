{"categories":["Designing","Manual","Programming","Testing","Web Development"],"desc":" This book covers the CherryPy library for Python web development from its history and installation through its main features and core concepts to its integration with Python and other products to construct, test, and deploy a sample photoblog application. The author Sylvain Hellegouarch is dedicated to the development of free software projects and has been coordinating and administrating the community efforts around the CherryPy project since 2004. The approach based on an example application introduces many other common Python libraries, providing transferable skills also relevant for non-web Python projects. This book is principally geared towards Python web developers, who are looking to add the power of the CherryPy library to their existing Python skillset. It assumes a good working knowledge of Python. Although the CherryPy toolkit is at the core of the book, many other common libraries are introduced.","details":{"authors":"Sylvain Hellegouarch","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1904811841","isbn-13":"978-1904811848","pages":"272 pages","publication date":"March 31, 2007","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"5.41Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/a8/a8bb0d431531c408331a4a75c22634ed.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/e84","title":"CherryPy Essentials: Rapid Python Web Application Development: Design, develop, test, and deploy your Python web applications easily"}
