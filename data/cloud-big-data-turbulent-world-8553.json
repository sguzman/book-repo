{"categories":["Big Data","Cloud Computing","Data Management","Data Mining"],"desc":" Cloud computing and big data are arguably the most significant forces in information technology today. In the wake of revelations about National Security Agency (NSA) activities, many of which occur “in the cloud”, this book offers both enlightenment and a critical view. Vincent Mosco explores where the cloud originated, what it means, and how important it is for business, government and citizens. He describes the intense competition among cloud companies like Amazon and Google, the spread of the cloud to government agencies like the controversial NSA, and the astounding growth of entire cloud cities in China. Is the cloud the long-promised information utility that will solve many of the world’s economic and social problems? Or is it just marketing hype? To the Cloud provides the first thorough analysis of the potential and the problems of a technology that may very well disrupt the world.","details":{"authors":"Vincent Mosco","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1612056164","isbn-13":"978-1612056166","pages":"284 pages","publication date":"June 1, 2014","publisher":"Routledge","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/8d/8dfc3c886aa549ca9840c598e076bc7e.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/81h","title":"To the Cloud: Big Data in a Turbulent World"}
