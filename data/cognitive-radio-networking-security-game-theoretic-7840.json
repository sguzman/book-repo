{"categories":["Game Development","Networking","Security"],"desc":" With the rapid growth of new wireless devices and applications over the past decade, the demand for wireless radio spectrum is increasing relentlessly. The development of cognitive radio networking provides a framework for making the best possible use of limited spectrum resources, and it is revolutionising the telecommunications industry. This book presents the fundamentals of designing, implementing, and deploying cognitive radio communication and networking systems. Uniquely, it focuses on game theory and its applications to various aspects of cognitive networking. It covers in detail the core aspects of cognitive radio, including cooperation, situational awareness, learning, and security mechanisms and strategies. In addition, it provides novel, state-of-the-art concepts and recent results. This is an ideal reference for researchers, students and professionals in industry who need to learn the applications of game theory to cognitive networking.","details":{"authors":"Beibei Wang","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521762316","isbn-13":"978-0521762311","pages":"618 pages","publication date":"November 29, 2010","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"6.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/64/64b0438944fbfc04fecf955c0f432bb6.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/aoq","title":"Cognitive Radio Networking and Security: A Game-Theoretic View"}
