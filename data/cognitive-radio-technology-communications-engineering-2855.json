{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" Cognitive radio technology is a smarter, faster, and more efficient way to transmit information to and from fixed, mobile, other wireless communication devices. Cognitive radio builds upon software-defined radio technology. A cognitive radio system is ‘aware’ of its operating environment and automatically adjusts itself to maintain desired communications―it’s like having a trained operator ‘inside’ the radio making constant adjustments for maximum performance. Operating frequency, power output, antenna orientation/beamwidth, modulation, and transmitter bandwidth are just a few of the operating parameters that can automatically be adjusted “on the fly in a cognitive radio system.
