{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" Complex Webs synthesises modern mathematical developments with a broad range of complex network applications of interest to the engineer and system scientist, presenting the common principles, algorithms, and tools governing network behaviour, dynamics, and complexity. The authors investigate multiple mathematical approaches to inverse power laws and expose the myth of normal statistics to describe natural and man-made networks. Richly illustrated throughout with real-world examples including cell phone use, accessing the Internet, failure of power grids, measures of health and disease, distribution of wealth, and many other familiar phenomena from physiology, bioengineering, biophysics, and informational and social networks, this book makes thought-provoking reading. With explanations of phenomena, diagrams, end-of-chapter problems, and worked examples, it is ideal for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and the life, social, and physical sciences. It is also a perfect introduction for researchers who are interested in this exciting new way of viewing dynamic networks.","details":{"authors":"Paolo Grigolini","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521113660","isbn-13":"978-0521113663","pages":"386 pages","publication date":"February 14, 2011","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/86/869bf9e08b1c5ba0bf1e0d8da88fb82c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/90w","title":"Complex Webs: Anticipating the Improbable"}
