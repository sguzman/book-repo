{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This is a straightforward, crisp, cut-and-dry way to prepare for the A+ exams. Providing 800 questions and answers for the new A+ exams, this is the “no-fluff” Q&A guide. With answers at the back of the book as opposed to right after the question, CompTIA A+ 2009 Q&A truly encourages self-study. The book’s questions cover everything you might encounter on the two A+ 2009 exams, Essentials 220-701 and Practical Application 220-702. You’ll get comprehensive questions covering software and every operating system (with emphasis on Windows XP and Vista), networking and security issues, PC repair and maintenance, and much more. Hardware is covered as well, of course–everything from P4 motherboards, notebooks, and printers to PDAs and wireless devices. The accurate content and convenient presentation of questions and answers offer a great solution to studying for these exams.","details":{"authors":"Inc.
