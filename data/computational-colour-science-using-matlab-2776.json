{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" Presenting a practical, problem-based approach to colour physics, this title describes the key issues encountered in modern colour engineering, including efficient representation of colour information, fourier analysis of reflectance spectra and advanced colorimetric computation. Emphasis is placed on the practical applications rather than the techniques themselves, with material structured around key topics, such as colour calibration of visual displays, computer recipe prediction and models for colour-appearance prediction.
