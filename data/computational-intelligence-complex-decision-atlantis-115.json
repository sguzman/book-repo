{"categories":["Engineering","Machine Learning"],"desc":" In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the need for designing intelligent systems to address complex decision systems. One of the most challenging issues for the intelligent system is to effectively handle real-world uncertainties that cannot be eliminated. These uncertainties include various types of information that are incomplete, imprecise, fragmentary, not fully reliable, vague, contradictory, deficient, and overloading. The uncertainties result in a lack of the full and precise knowledge of the decision system, including the determining and selection of evaluation criteria, alternatives, weights, assignment scores, and the final integrated decision result. Computational intelligent techniques (including fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms etc.), which are complimentary to the existing traditional techniques, have shown great potential to solve these demanding, real-world decision problems that exist in uncertain and unpredictable environments. These technologies have formed the foundation for intelligent systems.","details":{"authors":"Da Ruan","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9078677279","isbn-13":"978-9078677277","pages":"404 pages","publication date":"June 3, 2010","publisher":"Atlantis Press","size":"8.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/9a/9a6ee54d0002e06c9f3b7eea05dc613c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/byw","title":"Computational Intelligence in Complex Decision Systems (Atlantis Computational Intelligence Systems)"}
