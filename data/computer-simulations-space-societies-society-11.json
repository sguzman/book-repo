{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" At the intersection of astronautics, computer science, and social science, this book introduces the challenges and insights associated with computer simulation of human society in outer space, and of the dynamics of terrestrial enthusiasm for space exploration. Never before have so many dynamic representations of space-related social systems existed, some deeply analyzing the logical implications of social-scientific theories, and others open for experience by the general public as computer-generated virtual worlds. Fascinating software ranges from multi-agent artificial intelligence models of civilization, to space-oriented massively multiplayer online games, to educational programs suitable for schools or even for the worldâ€™s space exploration agencies. At the present time, when actual forays by humans into space are scarce, computer simulations of space societies are an excellent way to prepare for a renaissance of exploration beyond the bounds of Earth.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319905597","isbn-13":"978-3319905594","pages":"254 pages","publication date":"July 14, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"8.12Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/82/8205fb7fbebb22defe9725e00ba276d8.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/hds","title":"Computer Simulations of Space Societies"}
