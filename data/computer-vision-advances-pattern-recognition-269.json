{"categories":["Machine Learning"],"desc":" The first book of its kind devoted to this topic, this comprehensive text/reference presents state-of-the-art research and reviews current challenges in the application of computer vision to problems in sports. Opening with a detailed introduction to the use of computer vision across the entire life-cycle of a sports event, the text then progresses to examine cutting-edge techniques for tracking the ball, obtaining the whereabouts and pose of the players, and identifying the sport being played from video footage. The work concludes by investigating a selection of systems for the automatic analysis and classification of sports play. The insights provided by this pioneering collection will be of great interest to researchers and practitioners involved in computer vision, sports analysis and media production.","details":{"authors":"Thomas B.
