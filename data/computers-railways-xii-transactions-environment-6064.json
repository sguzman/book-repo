{"categories":["Designing","Engineering"],"desc":" This book contains the papers presented at the Twelfth International Conference on Computer System Design and Operation in Railways and Other Transit Systems being held Auguste 31 to September 2 in Beijing China. This biennial conference is the latest in a successful series that began in 1987. The conference provides a platform for transportation professionals to examine the new achievements and applications of computer based technologies in management, design and operation of passenger and freight transit systems. Rail transport has many advantages over other transportation systems in terms of capacity, punctuality, resistance to weather, fuel and land economies, and fairly low pollution. More and more governments are thus turning to high-speed rail systems as a backbone of sustainable transportation systems. Safety and efficiency are two major issues for railway operators. Computer based technologies have always played an important role in the safety and efficiency of transit systems. The book addresses all these topics, among others.","details":{"authors":"B..
