{"categories":["Computing","Manual","Programming"],"desc":" This book focuses on the programming concepts of C++ Lite, a popular subset of the C++ language. Following the recently released ANSI/ISO standard, it features coverage of the two vital additions to C++ Lite, including the string class and vector template. Discussions of these computing concepts draw on modern techniques of C++ programming by using objects and graphics. And most examples are given in the form of complete, ready-to-run programs.","details":{"authors":"Cay S.
