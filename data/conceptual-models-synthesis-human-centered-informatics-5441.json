{"categories":["Designing","Engineering"],"desc":" People make use of software applications in their activities, applying them as tools in carrying out tasks. That this use should be good for people–easy, effective, efficient, and enjoyable–is a principal goal of design. In this book, we present the notion of Conceptual Models, and argue that Conceptual Models are core to achieving good design. From years of helping companies create software applications, we have come to believe that building applications without Conceptual Models is just asking for designs that will be confusing and difficult to learn, remember, and use.
