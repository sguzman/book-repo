{"categories":["Programming","Software"],"desc":" Constraint logic programming lies at the intersection of logic programming, optimisation and artificial intelligence. It has proved a successful tool in many areas including production planning, transportation scheduling, numerical analysis and bioinformatics.  Eclipse is one of the leading software systems that realise its underlying methodology. Eclipse is exploited commercially by Cisco, and is freely available and used for teaching and research in over 500 universities. This book has a two-fold purpose. Itâ€™s an introduction to constraint programming, appropriate for one-semester courses for upper undergraduate or graduate students in computer science or for programmers wishing to master the practical aspects of constraint programming.  By the end of the book, the reader will be able to understand and write constraint programs that solve complex problems. Second, it provides a systematic introduction to the Eclipse system through carefully-chosen examples that guide the reader through the language and illustrate its power, versatility and utility.","details":{"authors":"Mark Wallace","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521866286","isbn-13":"978-0521866286","pages":"348 pages","publication date":"January 15, 2007","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/ac/ac1d85b669f6f365d0a438451980234c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/a7l","title":"Constraint Logic Programming using Eclipse"}
