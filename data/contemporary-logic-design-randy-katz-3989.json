{"categories":["Designing"],"desc":" BASIC APPROACH In the past ten years there has been a revolution in the practice of hardware design. Professionals now rely on CAD software, rapid prototyping, and programmable logic devices to streamline the design process. Contemporary Logic Design is the first text to address these changes â€” and to offer a truly modern introduction to logic design. Throughout, the author complements his presentation of logic design theory with discussions of current design technologies.
