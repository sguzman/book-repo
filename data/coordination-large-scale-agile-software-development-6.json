{"categories":["Engineering","Programming","Software Quality"],"desc":" This book explores coordination within and between teams in the context of large-scale agile software development, providing readers a deeper understanding of how coordinated action between teams is achieved in multiteam systems. An exploratory multiple case study with five multiteam systems and a total of 66 interviewees from development teams at SAP SE is presented and analyzed. In addition, the book explores stereotypes of coordination in large-scale agile settings and shares new perspectives on integrating conditions for coordination. No previous study has researched this topic with a similar data set, consisting of insights from professional software development teams. As such, the book will be of interest to all researchers and practitioners whose work involves software product development across several teams.","details":{"authors":"Alexander Scheerer","format":"epub","isbn-10":"3319553267","isbn-13":"978-3319553269","pages":"128 pages","publication date":"March 2, 2017","publisher":"Springer","size":"1.93Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/a1/a1bf95f2159cff4953b3e35b3849138c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dmk","title":"Coordination in Large-Scale Agile Software Development: Integrating Conditions and Configurations in Multiteam Systems (Progress in IS)"}
