{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" The promotion of CCTV surveillance and identity cards, along with ever heightened security at airports, immigration control and institutional access, has seen a dramatic increase in the use of automated and manual recognition. In addition, several recent disasters have highlighted the problems and challenges associated with current disaster victim identification. Discussing the latest advances and key research into identification from the face and skull, this book draws together a wide range of elements relating to craniofacial analysis and identification. It examines all aspects of facial identification, including the determination of facial appearance from the skull, comparison of the skull with the face and the verification of living facial images. With sections covering the identification of the dead and of the living, it provides a valuable review of the current state of play along with the latest research advances in this constantly evolving field.","details":{"authors":"Professor Caroline Wilkinson, Christopher Rynn","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521768624","isbn-13":"978-0521768627","pages":"272 pages","publication date":"June 29, 2012","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"24.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/8e/8efdd5e7519181ee8d262de3ee05ca9c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8j0","title":"Craniofacial Identification"}
