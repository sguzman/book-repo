{"categories":["Data Management"],"desc":" This volume arises from the tenth annual International Conference on Computers, Privacy, and Data Protection (CPDP 2017) held in Brussels in January 2017, bringing together papers that offer conceptual analyses, highlight issues, propose solutions, and discuss practices regarding privacy and data protection. Topics explored include: Directive 95/46/EU and the GDPR moving from a market framing to a ‘treaty-based’ games frame; the GDPR requirements regarding machine learning; the need for transparency in automated decision-making systems to warrant against wrong decisions and protecting privacy; the risk-revolution in EU data protection law; data security challenges of Industry 4.0 and (new) types of data introduced in the GDPR; privacy design implications of conversational agents; and reasonable expectations of data protection in Intelligent Orthoses. Data Protection and Privacy was written while the implications of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 were sinking in. It discusses open issues and daring and prospective approaches. This book will serve as an insightful resource for readers with an interest in computers, privacy, and data protection.
