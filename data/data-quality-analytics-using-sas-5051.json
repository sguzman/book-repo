Gerhard Svolbaâ€™s Data Quality for Analytics Using SAS focuses on selecting the right data sources and ensuring data quantity, relevancy, and completeness. The book is made up of three parts. The first part, which is conceptual, defines data quality and contains text, definitions, explanations, and examples. The second part shows how the data quality status can be profiled and the ways that data quality can be improved with analytical methods. The final part details the consequences of poor data quality for predictive modeling and time series forecasting.","details":{"authors":"Gerhard Svolba","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"160764620X","isbn-13":"978-1607646204","pages":"356 pages","publication date":"May 5, 2015","publisher":"SAS Institute","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/1e/1e645fde8941c60fbbb30888281d5792.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dai","title":"Data Quality for Analytics Using SAS"}
