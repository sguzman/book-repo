{"categories":["Algorithms","Data Management","Programming"],"desc":" Using the Java programming language, author Adam Drozdek highlights three important aspects of data structures and algorithms. First, the book places special emphasis on the connection between data structures and their algorithms, including an analysis of the algorithmsâ€™ complexity. Second, the book presents data structures in the context of object-oriented program design, stressing the principle of information hiding in its treatment of encapsulation and decomposition. Finally, the book closely examines data structure implementation. Overall, this practical and theoretical book prepares students with a solid foundation in data structures for future courses and work in design implementation, testing, or maintenance of virtually any software system.","details":{"authors":"Adam Drozdek","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0534492525","isbn-13":"978-0534492526","pages":"768 pages","publication date":"September 24, 2004","publisher":"Cengage Learning","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/44/444608ba4d6e6f90ae1fbed2b9cdc2fb.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9h8","title":"Data Structures and Algorithms in Java"}
