{"categories":["Designing","Image Processing"],"desc":" Dr Donald Bailey starts with introductory material considering the problem of embedded image processing, and how some of the issues may be solved using parallel hardware solutions. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are introduced as a technology that provides flexible, fine-grained hardware that can readily exploit parallelism within many image processing algorithms. A brief review of FPGA programming languages provides the link between a software mindset normally associated with image processing algorithms, and the hardware mindset required for efficient utilization of a parallel hardware design. The design process for implementing an image processing algorithm on an FPGA is compared with that for a conventional software implementation, with the key differences highlighted. Particular attention is given to the techniques for mapping an algorithm onto an FPGA implementation, considering timing, memory bandwidth and resource constraints, and efficient hardware computational techniques. Extensive coverage is given of a range of low and intermediate level image processing operations, discussing efficient implementations and how these may vary according to the application. The techniques are illustrated with several example applications or case studies from projects or applications he has been involved with. Issues such as interfacing between the FPGA and peripheral devices are covered briefly, as is designing the system in such a way that it can be more readily debugged and tuned.
