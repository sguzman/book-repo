{"categories":["Designing"],"desc":" This book describes a circuit architecture for converting real analog signals into a digital format, suitable for digital signal processors. This architecture, referred to as multi-stage noise-shaping (MASH) Continuous-Time Sigma-Delta Modulators (CT-ΔΣM), has the potential to provide better digital data quality and achieve better data rate conversion with lower power consumption.  The authors not only cover MASH continuous-time sigma delta modulator fundamentals, but also provide a literature review that will allow students, professors, and professionals to catch up on the latest developments in related technology.","details":{"authors":"Qiyuan Liu, Alexander Edward, Carlos Briseno-Vidrios, Jose Silva-Martinez","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319772244","isbn-13":"978-3319772240","pages":"208 pages","publication date":"May 3, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"12.31Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/57/5793d95044cf03160f42d9ff0d1e4a88.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/eyc","title":"Design Techniques for Mash Continuous-Time Delta-Sigma Modulators"}
