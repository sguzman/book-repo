{"categories":["Programming","Web Development"],"desc":" Today, web applications are the most important type of software applications. This textbook shows how to design and implement them, using a model-based engineering approach that covers general information management concepts and techniques and the two most relevant technology platforms: JavaScript and Java. The book provides an in-depth tutorial for theory-underpinned and example-based learning by doing it yourself, supported by quiz questions and practice projects. Volume 1 provides an introduction to web technologies and model-based web application engineering, discussing the information management concepts of constraint-based data validation, enumerations and special datatypes. Volume 2 discusses the advanced information management concepts of associations and inheritance in class hierarchies. Web apps are designed using UML class diagrams and implemented with two technologies: JavaScript for front-end (and distributed NodeJS) apps, and Java (with JPA and JSF) for back-end apps. The six example apps discussed in the book can be run, and their source code downloaded, from the bookâ€™s website.
