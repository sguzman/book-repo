{"categories":["Engineering","Web Development"],"desc":" This SpringerBrief examines the use of cheap commercial passive RFID tags to achieve accurate device-free object-tracking. It presents a sensitive detector, named Twins, which uses a pair of adjacent passive tags to detect uncooperative targets (such as intruders). Twins leverages a newly observed phenomenon called critical state that is caused by interference among passive tags. The author expands on the previous object tracking methods, which are mostly device-based, and reveals a new interference model and their extensive experiments for validation. A prototype implementation of the Twins-based intrusion detection scheme with commercial off-the-shelf reader and tags is also covered in this SpringerBrief. Device-Free Object Tracking Using Passive Tags is designed for researchers and professionals  interested in smart sensing, localization, RFID and Internet of Things applications. The content is also useful for advanced-level students studying electrical engineering and computer science.","details":{"authors":"Jinsong Han, Wei Xi, Kun Zhao, Zhiping Jiang","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319126458","isbn-13":"978-3319126456","pages":"62 pages","publication date":"November 22, 2014","publisher":"Springer","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/be/beebf6005ac62cb3e571f097f52811a6.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dgm","title":"Device-Free Object Tracking Using Passive Tags (SpringerBriefs in Electrical and Computer Engineering)"}
