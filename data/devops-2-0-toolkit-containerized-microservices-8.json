{"categories":["Software Quality"],"desc":" This book is about different techniques that help us architect software in a better and more efficient way with microservices packed as immutable containers, tested and deployed continuously to servers that are automatically provisioned with configuration management tools. It’s about fast, reliable and continuous deployments with zero-downtime and ability to roll-back. It’s about scaling to any number of servers, design of self-healing systems capable of recuperation from both hardware and software failures and about centralized logging and monitoring of the cluster.In other words, this book envelops the whole microservices development and deployment lifecycle using some of the latest and greatest practices and tools. We’ll use Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Ubuntu, Docker Swarm and Docker Compose, Consul, etcd, Registrator, confd, and so on. We’ll go through many practices and even more tools. Finally, while there will be a lot of theory, this is a hands-on book. You won’t be able to complete it by reading it in a metro on a way to work. You’ll have to read this book while in front of the computer and get your hands dirty.","details":{"authors":"Viktor Farcic","format":"epub","isbn-10":"152391744X","isbn-13":"978-1523917440","pages":"414 pages","publication date":"February 6, 2016","publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","size":"12.76Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/e2/e248f279147eee242afb743e2e4e63f4.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dop","title":"The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices"}
