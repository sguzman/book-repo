{"categories":["Designing","Programming"],"desc":" Digital arithmetic plays an important role in the design of general-purpose digital processors and of embedded systems for signal processing, graphics, and communications. In spite of a mature body of knowledge in digital arithmetic, each new generation of processors or digital systems creates new arithmetic design problems. Designers, researchers, and graduate students will find solid solutions to these problems in this comprehensive, state-of-the-art exposition of digital arithmetic.","details":{"authors":"Tom√°s Lang","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1558607986","isbn-13":"978-1558607989","pages":"709 pages","publication date":"June 24, 2003","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/d7/d7f1aaffff79f996cf2582521707a61c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8nn","title":"Digital Arithmetic (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Architecture and Design)"}
