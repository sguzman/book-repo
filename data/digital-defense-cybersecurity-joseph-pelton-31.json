{"categories":["Manual","Security"],"desc":" Drs. Pelton and Singh warn of the increasing risks of cybercrime and lay out a series of commonsense precautions to guard against individual security breaches. This guide clearly explains the technology at issue, the points of weakness and the best ways to proactively monitor and maintain the integrity of individual networks. Covering both the most common personal attacks of identity fraud, phishing, malware and breach of access as well as the larger threats against companies and governmental systems, the authors explain the vulnerabilities of the internet age. As more and more of life’s transactions take place online, the average computer user and society at large have a lot to lose. All users can take steps to secure their information. Cybercrime is so subtle and hidden, people can ignore the threat until it is too late. Yet today about every three seconds a person is hit by some form of cyber attack out of the blue. Locking the “cyber-barn door” after a hacker has struck is way too late. Cyber security, cyber crime and cyber terrorism may seem to be intellectual crimes that don’t really touch the average person, but the threat is real. Demystifying them is the most important step and this accessible explanation covers all the bases.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319199528","isbn-13":"978-3319199528","pages":"209 pages","publication date":"October 17, 2015","publisher":"Copernicus","size":"6.66Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/2a/2ab96c734b448808a718c73d2cc1cc00.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h7r","title":"Digital Defense: A Cybersecurity Primer"}
