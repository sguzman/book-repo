{"categories":["Digital Design/Media","Engineering","Manual","Signal Processing"],"desc":" Digital technology now enables unparalleled functionality and flexibility in the capture, processing, exchange, and output of color images. But harnessing its potential requires knowledge of color science, systems, processing algorithms, and device characteristics-topics drawn from a broad range of disciplines. One can acquire the requisite background with an armload of physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, and mathematics books and journals- or one can find it here, in the Digital Color Imaging Handbook.","details":{"authors":"Gaurav Sharma, Raja Bala","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"084930900X","isbn-13":"978-0849309007","pages":"575 pages","publication date":"December 23, 2002","publisher":"CRC Press","size":"17.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/23/23a1d6af68bb6e5679d4f0e8589cdb56.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/7wa","title":"Digital Color Imaging Handbook (Electrical Engineering & Applied Signal Processing Series)"}
