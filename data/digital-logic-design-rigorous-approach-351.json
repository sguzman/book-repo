{"categories":["Designing"],"desc":" This introductory textbook, based on the authors’ 15 years experience in teaching logic design, is a complete teaching tool for turning students into logic designers in one semester. It covers combinational circuits, basic computer arithmetic, synchronous circuits, finite state machines, logical simulation, and an implementation of a simple RISC processor and its machine language. Each chapter first describes new concepts and then gives extensive applications and examples of these new ideas. Assuming no prior knowledge of discrete mathematics, the authors introduce all the necessary background in propositional logic, asymptotics, graphs, hardware and electronics. Important features of the presentation are: • Every designed circuit is formally specified and implemented; the correctness of the implementation is proved, and the cost and delay are analyzed • Algorithmic solutions are offered for tasks such as logical simulation, computation of propagation delay, and minimum clock period • Connections are drawn from the physical analog world to the digital abstraction • The language of graphs is used to describe formulas and circuits • Hundreds of figures, examples and exercises enhance understanding The extensive website http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~guy/Even-Medina/ includes teaching slides and links to Logisim and a DLX assembly simulator.","details":{"authors":"Moti Medina","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1107027535","isbn-13":"978-1107027534","pages":"365 pages","publication date":"October 8, 2012","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/75/758600ce02eb068bb97670dbc701794a.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/apd","title":"Digital Logic Design: A Rigorous Approach"}
