{"categories":["Computer Science","Engineering"],"desc":" th The 8 International Workshop on Digital Watermarking (IWDW 2009) was hosted by the University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK, during August 24- 26, 2009.As with previous workshops, IWDW 2009 aimed to providea balanced program covering the latest state-of-the-art theoretical and practical devel- ments in digital watermarking, steganography and steganalysis, and the eme- ing area of image forensics. The selection of the program was a challenging task for the Technical Programme Committee members and reviewers, who ensured the highest quality and reputation of the workshop. From around 50 submissions received from authors in 14 countries, the c- mittee selected 26 regular papers (22 oral and 4 poster presentations). In â€“ dition to the contributed papers, the workshop featured three keynote lectures on watermarking, cryptography and forensics kindly delivered by internati- ally renowned experts, Ingemar Cox, Fred Piper and Ed Delp, respectively. The regular papers and keynote lectures can be found in this proceedings volume. First of all, we would like to thank all the authors, speakers, reviewers and participants for their signi?cant contributions to the success of IWDW 2009.","details":{"authors":"Anthony T. S.
