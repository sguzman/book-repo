{"categories":["Computing"],"desc":" Written with a clear and informal style “Discrete Mathematics for Computing” is aimed at first-year undergraduate computing students with very little mathematical background. It is a low-level introductory text which takes the topics at a gentle pace, covering all the essential material that forms the background for studies in computing and information systems. This edition includes new sections on proof methods and recurrences, and the examples have been updated throughout to reflect the changes in computing since the first edition.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0333981111","isbn-13":"978-0333981115","pages":"320 pages","publication date":"August 16, 2002","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan","size":"1.15Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/a7/a732462b52c08091d5bd76f5121ed813.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h53","title":"Discrete Mathematics for Computing (Grassroots)"}
