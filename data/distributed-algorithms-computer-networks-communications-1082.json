{"categories":["Algorithms","Networking"],"desc":" This book presents a comprehensive review of key distributed graph algorithms for computer network applications, with a particular emphasis on practical implementation. Topics and features: introduces a range of fundamental graph algorithms, covering spanning trees, graph traversal algorithms, routing algorithms, and self-stabilization; reviews graph-theoretical distributed approximation algorithms with applications in ad hoc wireless networks; describes in detail the implementation of each algorithm, with extensive use of supporting examples, and discusses their concrete network applications; examines key graph-theoretical algorithm concepts, such as dominating sets, and parameters for mobility and energy levels of nodes in wireless ad hoc networks, and provides a contemporary survey of each topic; presents a simple simulator, developed to run distributed algorithms; provides practical exercises at the end of each chapter.","details":{"authors":"Kayhan Erciyes","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1447151720","isbn-13":"978-1447151722","pages":"324 pages","publication date":"May 16, 2013","publisher":"Springer","size":"3.65Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/ea/ea418485f3c2308d778d602b6e07245b.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9hr","title":"Distributed Graph Algorithms for Computer Networks (Computer Communications and Networks)"}
