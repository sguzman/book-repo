{"categories":["Data Management","Databases","Engineering","Management"],"desc":" This book addresses issues related to managing data across a distributed database system. It is unique because it covers traditional database theory and current research, explaining the difficulties in providing a unified user interface and global data dictionary. The book gives implementers guidance on hiding discrepancies across systems and creating the illusion of a single repository for users. It also includes three sample frameworks—implemented using J2SE with JMS, J2EE, and Microsoft .Net—that readers can use to learn how to implement a distributed database management system. IT and development groups and computer sciences/software engineering graduates will find this guide invaluable.","details":{"authors":"Saeed K. Rahimi, Frank S.
