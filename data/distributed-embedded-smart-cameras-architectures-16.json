{"categories":["Designing","Programming"],"desc":" This publication addresses distributed embedded smart cameras â€“cameras that perform on board analysis and collaborate with other cameras. This book provides the material required to better understand the architectural design challenges of embedded smart camera systems, the hardware/software ecosystem, the design approach for and applications of distributed smart cameras together with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The authors concentrate on the architecture, hardware/software design, realization of smart camera networks from applications to architectures, in particular in the embedded and mobile domains.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1461477042","isbn-13":"978-1461477044","pages":"273 pages","publication date":"June 5, 2014","publisher":"Springer","size":"12.72Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/09/096757844a361cd830484efa13bd3d36.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h5o","title":"Distributed Embedded Smart Cameras: Architectures, Design and Applications"}
