{"categories":["Designing"],"desc":" Do more with SOA Integration: Best of Packt  takes less of a discussion, and a more value approach to helping you to learn all you can about SOA integration. A medley of eight Packt books; each chapter has its own unique style so that you can learn from not only content written in a step-by-step tutorial style, but also from handbook and cookbook chapters. If you are a SOA architect or consultant who wants to extend your knowledge of SOA integration with the help of a wide variety of Packt books, particularly covering Oracle tools and products, then  Do more with SOA Integration: Best of Packt  is for you. You should have a good grasp of Service Oriented Architecture, but not necessarily of integration principles. Knowledge of vendor-specific tools would be an advantage but is not essential.","details":{"authors":"Arun Poduval, Doug Todd, Harish Gaur, Jeremy Bolie, Kevin Geminiuc, Lawrence Pravin, Markus Zirn, Matjaz B.
