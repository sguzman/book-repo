{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" This hands-on guide takes a look at the main functional areas of Drupal that have significant new features. It explains these new features and how to use them, drawing attention to significant differences from how things used to behave, and giving the reader an idea of the kind of consequences these changes will bring to them. Drupal 7 First Look is written for site administrators, themers, and developers who have some experience with Drupal 6 (or even Drupal 5) and want to upgrade their sites, themes, or modules to Drupal 7 or just learn more about Drupal 7. No programming experience is required, but several code examples are covered for readers that want more in-depth information about building themes and modules.","details":{"authors":"Mark Noble","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849511225","isbn-13":"978-1849511223","pages":"288 pages","publication date":"August 30, 2010","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/5e/5e782f06bbd63e1e161b8fdd1fb7462d.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/gxu","title":"Drupal 7 First Look"}
