With each chapter, you add new features and content until your social network is ready to be released to the Internet where it can grow.

Hobbyists – create a community around your hobbies and interests; create a local or distributed user group. Organizations and charities – raise your profile, promote your events, services, and fundraisers, and get help from the community in organizing them. Families – for large families based across the country or across the globe, keep up to date with everyone, and let everyone know what you are up to. You don’t need any experience of Drupal or PHP to use this book. If you are a Drupal user you will find this book a great way to rapidly tailor an existing installation into a socially orientated website.","details":{"authors":"Michael Peacock","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849516006","isbn-13":"978-1849516006","pages":"328 pages","publication date":"September 21, 2011","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/c7/c731e71a3d9572319d5ee376e71709b3.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/f02","title":"Drupal 7 Social Networking"}
