{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" This book helps you understand the logic behind the theming system employed in Drupal, and how to make it work for you. You will learn key concepts and work through examples with careful, step-by-step instructions. The main requirements to make use of this book are knowledge of HTML, CSS, and a touch of creativity – you don’t need to know anything about theming in Drupal, although you should be familiar with the basic operation of the Drupal system. Although this book aims to make Drupal theming accessible to designers, theming in Drupal 6 involves writing some PHP code, and a basic knowledge of PHP will be helpful. Regardless of your technical skills, this book will teach you to design themes for your Drupal websites in the easiest way.","details":{"authors":"Ric Shreves","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847195660","isbn-13":"978-1847195661","pages":"312 pages","publication date":"September 30, 2008","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"7.32Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/41/41e9a2af2874b25676fca8fd439d552c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/g4r","title":"Drupal 6 Themes: Create new themes for your Drupal 6 site with clean layout and powerful CSS styling"}
