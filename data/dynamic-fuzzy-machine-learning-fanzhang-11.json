{"categories":["Engineering","Machine Learning","Manual"],"desc":" This book develops a self-contained framework for machine learning based on dynamic fuzzy model via elabrating on concepts and algorithms. It further explains mechanisms for agent learning and agent ubiquitous learning, and discusses design of Bayesian quantum stochastic learning for various environments. Demonstrating theories with practical examples, the book is of interests to computer scientists and engineers on artificial intelligence.","details":{"authors":"Fanzhang / Zhang, Li / Zhang, Zhao Li","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3110518708","isbn-13":"978-3110518702","pages":"323 pages","publication date":"December 4, 2017","publisher":"De Gruyter","size":"10.09Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/46/462889407528be1721cb120390b27625.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/d3e","title":"Dynamic Fuzzy Machine Learning"}
