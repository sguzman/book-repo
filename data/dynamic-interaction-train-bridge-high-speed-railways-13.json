{"categories":["Engineering","Programming"],"desc":" This book presents both the fundamental theory and numerical calculations and field experiments used in a range of practical engineering projects. It not only provides theoretical formulations and various solutions, but also offers concrete methods to extend the life of existing bridge structures and presents a guide to the rational design of new bridges, such as high-speed railway bridges and long-span bridges. Further, it offers a reference resource for solving vehicleâ€“structure dynamic interaction problems in the research on and design of all types of highways, railways and other transport structures.","details":{"authors":"He Xia, Nan Zhang, Weiwei Guo","format":"epub","isbn-10":"3662548690","isbn-13":"978-3662548691","pages":"580 pages","publication date":"October 29, 2017","publisher":"Springer","size":"13.32Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/11/11e11edb256bef1f38e7944f65b068cd.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/drg","title":"Dynamic Interaction of Train-Bridge Systems in High-Speed Railways: Theory and Applications (Advances in High-speed Rail Technology)"}
