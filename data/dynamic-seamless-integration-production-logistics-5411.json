{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This book contributes a basic framework for and specific insights into interdisciplinary connections between production, logistics, and traffic subsystems. The book is divided into two parts, the first of which presents an overview of interdisciplinarity in value-added networks and freight traffic. This includes an introduction to the topic and a description of an integrated framework of production, logistics, and traffic. Furthermore, it describes the barriers and challenges of interdisciplinary decision-making and project management. In turn, the second part presents domain-specific perspectives on interdisciplinary decision support, exploring domain-specific challenges of interdisciplinary interfaces and requirements for management methods and instruments from the standpoint of production management, logistics management, traffic management, and information technologies.  ","details":{"authors":"Eberhard Abele, Manfred Boltze, Hans-Christian Pfohl","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319410954","isbn-13":"978-3319410951","pages":"207 pages","publication date":"October 15, 2016","publisher":"Springer","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/02/02540746bd7db985c39921a2d18e7c82.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/a77","title":"Dynamic and Seamless Integration of Production, Logistics and Traffic: Fundamentals of Interdisciplinary Decision Support"}
