{"categories":["Mobile Development","Networking","Telecommunications"],"desc":" Ulrich Türke introduces innovative models and algorithms for the evaluation of WCDMA/UMTS network performance. He establishes an advanced snapshot analysis method which allows the efficient and accurate analysis of large radio networks. The author develops two statistical evaluation methods which furnish quick approximations of relevant results from snapshot simulations. Finally, he discusses the application of these methods to automatic network optimization. The majority of the developed strategies are successfully applied in a commercial radio network planning and optimization tool.","details":{"authors":"Ulrich Türke","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3835009036","isbn-13":"978-3835009035","pages":"165 pages","publication date":"September 25, 2007","publisher":"Deutscher Universitätsverlag","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/7b/7b17b2c17c2f61f6c2b43a422a5cdec1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/elc","title":"Efficient Methods for WCDMA Radio Network Planning and Optimization (Advanced Studies Mobile Research Center Bremen)"}
