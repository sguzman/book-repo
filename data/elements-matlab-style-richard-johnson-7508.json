{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" The Elements of MATLAB Style is a guide for both new and experienced MATLAB programmers. It provides a comprehensive collection of standards and guidelines for creating solid MATLAB code that will be easy to understand, enhance, and maintain. It is written for both individuals and those working in teams in which consistency is critical. This is the only book devoted to MATLAB style and best programming practices, focusing on how MATLAB code can be written in order to maximize its effectiveness. Just as Strunk and Whiteâ€™s The Elements of Style provides rules for writing in the English language, this book provides conventions for formatting, naming, documentation, programming and testing. It includes many concise examples of correct and incorrect usage, as well as coverage of the latest language features. The author also provides recommendations on use of the integrated development environment features that help produce better, more consistent software.","details":{"authors":"Richard K.
