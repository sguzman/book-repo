{"categories":["Machine Learning"],"desc":" As a graduate student at Ohio State in the mid-1970s, I inherited a unique c- puter vision laboratory from the doctoral research of previous students. They had designed and built an early frame-grabber to deliver digitized color video from a (very large) electronic video camera on a tripod to a mini-computer (sic) with a (huge!) disk drive―about the size of four washing machines. They had also – signed a binary image array processor and programming language, complete with a user’s guide, to facilitate designing software for this one-of-a-kindprocessor. The overall system enabled programmable real-time image processing at video rate for many operations. I had the whole lab to myself. I designed software that detected an object in the eldofview,trackeditsmovementsinrealtime,anddisplayedarunningdescription of the events in English. For example: “An object has appeared in the upper right corner…Itismovingdownandtotheleft…Nowtheobjectisgettingcloser…The object moved out of sight to the left”―about like that. The algorithms were simple, relying on a suf cient image intensity difference to separate the object from the background (a plain wall). From computer vision papers I had read, I knew that vision in general imaging conditions is much more sophisticated. But it worked, it was great fun, and I was hooked.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"184800303X","isbn-13":"978-1848003033","pages":"284 pages","publication date":"October 9, 2008","publisher":"Springer","size":"10.52Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/85/85afb86e4e770c55088c1df7a4458cab.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ha6","title":"Embedded Computer Vision (Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)"}
