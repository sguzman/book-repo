{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" The Affective Computing domain, term coined by Rosalind Picard in 1997, gathers several scientific areas such as computer science, cognitive science, psychology, design and art. The humane-machine interaction systems are no longer solely fast and efficient. They aim to offer to users affective experiences: userâ€™s affective state is detected and considered within the interaction; the system displays affective state; it can reason about their implication to achieve a task or resolve a problem. In this book, we have chosen to cover various domains of research in emotion-oriented systems. Our aim is also to highlight the importance to base the computational model on theoretical foundations and on natural data.","details":{"authors":"Catherine Pelachaud","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1848212585","isbn-13":"978-1848212589","pages":"352 pages","publication date":"December 12, 2011","publisher":"Wiley-ISTE","size":"8.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/cd/cd4017928a3ed5f82cf750aa8add9162.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/grm","title":"Emotion-Oriented Systems"}
