{"categories":["Machine Learning","Manual","Networking"],"desc":" This book provides theoretical and practical knowledge about a methodology for evolutionary algorithm-based search strategy with the integration of several machine learning and deep learning techniques. These include convolutional neural networks, Gr√∂bner bases, relevance vector machines, transfer learning, bagging and boosting methods, clustering techniques (affinity propagation), and belief networks, among others. The development of such tools contributes to better optimizing methodologies. Beginning with the essentials of evolutionary algorithms and covering interdisciplinary research topics, the contents of this book are valuable for different classes of readers: novice, intermediate, and also expert readers from related fields.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9811301999","isbn-13":"978-9811301995","pages":"245 pages","publication date":"July 19, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"21.38Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/45/452d30f97cb5e5d14e0b75dbaf0fadb7.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/hff","title":"Evolutionary Approach to Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks: Neuro-Evolution and Gene Regulatory Networks"}
