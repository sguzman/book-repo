{"categories":["Manual","Software"],"desc":" FileMaker Pro 10 Bible provides information that grows with you no matter what your level when you start. Topics range from the general (how databases fit into real life and your business needs; comparisons with other database development tools; a broad discussion of integration with existing systems and software) through the building-blocks of FileMaker solutions, and on up to state-of-the-art advice on concepts of optimization, modularization, innovative and sophisticated user-interface design, dynamic elements, logic, cutting-edge calculations, publishing your database to the Web, and integrating tightly with SQL databases via “ESS”. The book also includes the special developer tools available in FileMaker Pro Advanced, and covers topics too oft skipped over in other books on the market — backup how-to’s and strategies, must-read information about good database husbandry and file recovery, and so on. Much of the information in the book is documented nowhere else. This is the one must-have FileMaker book!
