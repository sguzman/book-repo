{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" This book is intended to be used as both a text book and as an aide memoire handbook by forensic radio survey engineers, particularly those working for official police agencies. The book provides a simple but detailed overview of the operation of cellular networks (GSM, UMTS and LTE, US CDMAOne/CDMA2000, amongst others). In addition, the author also provides an overview of the technical theories that underpin cellular radio systems â€“ basic radio theory and a simple explanation of the mathematical concepts that underlie measurements scales such as dB and dBm. The main part of the book, however, focuses on radio surveys, the various types of survey, the techniques employed for each survey and the considerations and potential problems that can be encountered when surveying different types of network. The final section deals with processing and interpreting the results of radio surveys and examines the information that can be gained from them.","details":{"authors":"Joseph Hoy","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1118925734","isbn-13":"978-1118925737","pages":"400 pages","publication date":"February 23, 2015","publisher":"Wiley","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/37/377b0d887f68bad4c09fca448cb91d55.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/c2a","title":"Forensic Radio Survey Techniques for Cell Site Analysis"}
