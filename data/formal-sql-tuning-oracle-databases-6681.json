{"categories":["Data Management","Databases"],"desc":" The target of  SQL tuning is  the improvement of the existing execution plan.  The authors discuss the removal of brakes in the execution plan. Such “brakes” or bottlenecks can be recognized by a formal analysis of the execution plan. For this purpose no data model knowledge is needed. This is especially beneficial for database administrators because they are usually not or insufficiently  familiar with the data model. The book presents numerous practical examples with this method.","details":{"authors":"Leonid Nossov, Hanno Ernst, Victor Chupis","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3662504162","isbn-13":"978-3662504161","pages":"109 pages","publication date":"September 17, 2016","publisher":"Springer","size":"8.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/7d/7d45ae8db48fe766a8565e17426de04a.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8d7","title":"Formal SQL Tuning for Oracle Databases: Practical Efficiency – Efficient Practice"}
