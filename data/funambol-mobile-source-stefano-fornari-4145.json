{"categories":["Mobile Development"],"desc":" The book is composed of two parts. The first part will take you through the steps required to fully understand and deploy Funambol to provide PIM synchronization and push email solution to your mobile users. This is done step-by-step, starting from a simple personal usage scenario to a more complex environment that must serve thousands of users. All components of the platform are smoothly introduced and explained, starting from the functionality they provide. The second part of the book is more informative and will assist you in building Funambol extensions. In particular, it contains an easy-to-follow tutorial that will allow you to write a Funambol connector in a few easy steps. If you are looking forward to install and get started with Funambol, this book is for you. You need to have a technical background and be confident with a bit of code tweaking, but not a developer. General server administration skills are assumed and familiarity with Java will be a benefit in places.","details":{"authors":"Stefano Fornari","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847191541","isbn-13":"978-1847191540","pages":"272 pages","publication date":"December 17, 2009","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"6.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/ed/ed4af53bf7355fbfbb8968d1a2f611c1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/gnx","title":"Funambol Mobile Open Source"}
