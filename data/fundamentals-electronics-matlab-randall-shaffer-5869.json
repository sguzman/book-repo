{"categories":["Engineering","Hardware"],"desc":" Most power electronics textbooks use PSpice for the simulation of circuits, even though MATLAB is a much easier and user-friendly tool. Â”Fundamentals of Power Electronics Using MATLABÂ” teaches students and engineers how to use MATLAB as a simulation and computational tool for power electronics. Designed as a hands-on reference, the scope of the material in the text is not as broad as other reference-style texts, thus making the material less intimidating and more attainable. Each portion of the text starts with an example based on the section material, followed by a detailed solution. A conclusion is then drawn to emphasize the “point” of the problem and finally an exercise similar to the example is presented to challenge the reader. This format provides an immediate illustration of how to use the material and an opportunity for students to apply the material on their own. Engineers and students do not need to be proficient in MATLAB to work along with the text because a toolbox is provided on the companion CD-ROM that allows them to use MATLAB and obtain results immediately. The toolbox provides functions to perform power computations, waveform analysis, and power converter circuit design and simulations.","details":{"authors":"Randall Shaffer","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1584508523","isbn-13":"978-1584508526","pages":"600 pages","publication date":"August 11, 2006","publisher":"Charles River Media","size":"35.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b3/b3313623836d00c229807fcabd98f5a5.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/813","title":"Fundamentals Of Power Electronics With Matlab"}
