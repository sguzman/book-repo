{"categories":["Data Management","Programming"],"desc":" Written for computer programming students, hobbyists, and professionals, FUNDAMENTALS OF PYTHON: DATA STRUCTURES is an introduction to object-oriented design and data structures using the popular Python programming language. The level of instruction assumes at least one semester of programming in an object-oriented language such as Java, C++, or Python. Through the step-by-step instruction and exercises in this book, youâ€™ll cover such topics as the design of collection classes with polymorphism and inheritance, multiple implementations of collection interfaces, and the analysis of the space/time tradeoffs of different collection implementations (specifically array-based implementations and link-based implementations). Collections covered include sets, lists, stacks, queues, trees, dictionaries, and graphs.
