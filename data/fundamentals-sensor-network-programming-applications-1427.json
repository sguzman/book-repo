{"categories":["Networking","Programming"],"desc":" This book provides the basics needed to develop sensor network software and supplements it with many case studies covering network applications. It also examines how to develop onboard applications on individual sensors, how to interconnect these sensors, and how to form networks of sensors, although the major aim of this book is to provide foundational principles of developing sensor networking software and critically examine sensor network applications.","details":{"authors":"S.
