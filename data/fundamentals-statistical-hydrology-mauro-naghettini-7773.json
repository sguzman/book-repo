{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This textbook covers the main applications of statistical methods in hydrology. It is written for upper undergraduate and graduate students but can be used as a helpful guide for hydrologists, geographers, meteorologists and engineers. The book is very useful for teaching, as it covers the main topics of the subject and contains many worked out examples and proposed exercises. Starting from simple notions of the essential graphical examination of hydrological data, the book gives a complete account of the role that probability considerations must play during modelling, diagnosis of model fit, prediction and evaluating the uncertainty in model predictions, including the essence of Bayesian application in hydrology and statistical methods under nonstationarity.","details":{"authors":"Mauro Naghettini","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319435604","isbn-13":"978-3319435602","pages":"660 pages","publication date":"October 27, 2016","publisher":"Springer","size":"13.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/d8/d8a40c1253bdcf0b72d2d83ee3f582ce.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bbd","title":"Fundamentals of Statistical Hydrology"}
