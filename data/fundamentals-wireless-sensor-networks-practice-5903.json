{"categories":["Networking","Telecommunications"],"desc":" In this book, the authors describe the fundamental concepts and practical aspects of wireless sensor networks. The book provides a comprehensive view to this rapidly evolving field, including its many novel applications, ranging from protecting civil infrastructure to pervasive health monitoring. Using detailed examples and illustrations, this book provides an inside track on the current state of the technology. The book is divided into three parts. In Part I, several node architectures, applications and operating systems are discussed. In Part II, the basic architectural frameworks, including the key building blocks required for constructing large-scale, energy-efficient sensor networks are presented. In Part III, the challenges and approaches pertaining to local and global management strategies are presented â€“ this includes topics on power management, sensor node localization, time synchronization, and security. At the end of each chapter, the authors provide practical exercises to help students strengthen their grip on the subject. There are more than 200 exercises altogether.","details":{"authors":"Christian Poellabauer","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0470997656","isbn-13":"978-0470997659","pages":"330 pages","publication date":"August 30, 2010","publisher":"Wiley","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/f7/f771e9a285613d9be21130e07f1ba923.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bf4","title":"Fundamentals of Wireless Sensor Networks: Theory and Practice"}
