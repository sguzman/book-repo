{"categories":["Computer Science","Engineering"],"desc":" Irrespective of whether we use economic or societal metrics, the Internet is one of the most important technical infrastructures in existence today. It will be a catalyst for much of our innovation and prosperity in the future. A competitive Europe will require Internet connectivity and services beyond the capabilities offered by current technologies. Future Internet research is therefore a must. This book is published in full compliance with the Open Access publishing initiative; it is based on the research carried out within the Future Internet Assembly (FIA). It contains a sample of representative results from the recent FIA meetings spanning a broad range of topics, all being of crucial importance for the future Internet. The book includes 32 contributions and has been structured into the following sections, each of which is preceded by a short introduction: Foundations: architectural issues; socio-economic issues; security and trust; and experiments and experimental design. Future Internet Areas: networks, services, and content; and applications.","details":{"authors":"John Domingue, Alex Galis, Theodore Zahariadis, Dave Lambert, Frances Cleary, Petros Daras, Srdjan Krco, Henning MÃ¼ller, Man-Sze Li, Hans Schaffers, Volkmar Lotz, Federico Alvarez, Burkhard Stiller, Susanna Avessta, Michael Nilsson","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3642208975","isbn-13":"978-3642208973","pages":"465 pages","publication date":"June 27, 2011","publisher":"Springer","size":"11.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b9/b948d495b6517c29dd6300900dc418ad.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/g4j","title":"The Future Internet: Future Internet Assembly 2011: Achievements and Technological Promises (Lecture Notes in Computer Science)"}
