{"categories":["Computer Science","Engineering"],"desc":"This book provides a timely overview of fuzzy graph theory, laying the foundation for future applications in a broad range of areas. It introduces readers to fundamental theories, such as Craine’s work on fuzzy interval graphs, fuzzy analogs of Marczewski’s theorem, and the Gilmore and Hoffman characterization. It also introduces them to the Fulkerson and Gross characterization and Menger’s theorem, the applications of which will be discussed in a forthcoming book by the same authors. This book also discusses in detail important concepts such as connectivity, distance and saturation in fuzzy graphs.","details":{"authors":"Sunil Mathew (Author),‎ John N.
