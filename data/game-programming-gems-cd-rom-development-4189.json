{"categories":["Game Development","Programming"],"desc":" Welcome to the sixth volume of the Game Programming Gems series. With team sizes constantly expanding, developers are finding themselves pushed to become increasingly specialized. This makes it important to have cutting-edge, ready-to-use material in your specialization, as well as resources that you can call upon if you need to work outside your area of expertise. Volume 6 has been explicitly designed with your current challenges in mind. With the new generation of machines, players expect higher-fidelity models and animations, fancier physics and graphics effects, and more intelligent AI. All of these capabilities require robust teams and longer schedules, so to help ensure that your games are still delivered on time and on budget, you’ll find 50 all new articles written by experts in game technology from many different backgrounds and over twenty countries. This volume also includes a brand new section dedicated to Scripting and Data-Driven Systems, which is focused entirely on the growing trend of removing the programmer from the data-tweaking loop.  So, whether you’re a new game programmer starting out on this exciting path, a grizzled, industry veteran, or a most welcome visitor, we hope that you will find inspiration, insight, and at least one or two true gems to use in your world!","details":{"authors":"Mike Dickheiser","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1584504501","isbn-13":"978-1584504504","pages":"700 pages","publication date":"March 7, 2006","publisher":"Cengage Learning","size":"30.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/59/59644a4f964a66f2e22b345320b9ee16.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8qs","title":"Game Programming Gems 6 (Book & CD-ROM) (Game Development Series)"}
