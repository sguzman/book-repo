{"categories":["Version Control"],"desc":" Git is a version control Swiss army knife. A reliable versatile multipurpose revision control tool whose extraordinary flexibility makes it tricky to learn, let alone master.    As Arthur C. Clarke observed, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. This is a great way to approach Git: newbies can ignore its inner workings and view Git as a gizmo that can amaze friends and infuriate enemies with its wondrous abilities.    Rather than describe one mysterious command after another, we provide recipes for typical workflows. After repeated use, you will inevitably gain proficiency with Git.","details":{"authors":"Ben Lynn","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1451523343","isbn-13":"978-1451523348","pages":"64 pages","publication date":"April 5, 2010","publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","size":"0.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/83/839841a7ff2a179954f6585c6bdfab90.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/anq","title":"Git Magic"}
