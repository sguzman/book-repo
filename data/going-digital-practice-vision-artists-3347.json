{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Never before has a single instrument served in the creation of art the way that digital technology does, from photographic image making, to animation, to traditional painting.  Digital technology will become essential to creating and understanding art in the 21st century.  “Going Digital: The Practice and Vision of Digital Artists,” takes the unique approach of combining a how-to guide with critical and theoretical discussion.  Readers have the chance to see how a select group of artists each working in their own distinct styles approach a common compositional challenge.  Each artist will be given a set of identical images and will create an original work of art, documenting each step that leads to the finished piece and providing discussion of how their work is enhanced by digital technology.  Featuring rich imagery and instructional text that guide the reader through each step, each artist’s presentation will also be placed within the context of art history or theory to stimulate thought and discussion of the challenges of digital art making.  “Going Digital: The Practice and Vision of Digital Artists” provides readers with both the hands-on how-to and the practical knowledge necessary to create, discuss, and present art using digital technology.","details":{"authors":"Joseph Nalven, JD Jarvis","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1592009182","isbn-13":"978-1592009183","pages":"411 pages","publication date":"July 25, 2005","publisher":"Cengage Learning PTR","size":"47.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/28/28e8573b2c837f95fb98e765b469a344.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/91p","title":"Going Digital: The Practice and Vision of Digital Artists"}
