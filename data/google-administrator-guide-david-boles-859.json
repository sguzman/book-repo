You can create your own personalized web and email addresses, and get loads of free storage. You can connect with others and access your documents 24/7, no matter where you are. Best of all, it’s all hosted by Google–you get the same bandwidth, service, and machines that Google provides its staff and other online clients, and there’s no hardware or software for you to install or maintain. Google Apps Administrator Guide is for aspiring and practicing webmasters or IT Professionals from any small business, university, college, eBay shop, charity organization, or any other kind of group that wants to work together.
