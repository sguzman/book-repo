{"categories":["Algorithms"],"desc":" Shimon Evenâ€™s Graph Algorithms, published in 1979, was a seminal introductory book on algorithms read by everyone engaged in the field. This thoroughly revised second edition, with a foreword by Richard M. Karp and notes by Andrew V. Goldberg, continues the exceptional presentation from the first edition and explains algorithms in a formal but simple language with a direct and intuitive presentation.      The book begins by covering basic material, including graphs and shortest paths, trees, depth-first-search, and breadth-first search. The main part of the book is devoted to network flows and applications of network flows, and it ends with chapters on planar graphs and testing graph planarity.","details":{"authors":"Guy Even","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521736536","isbn-13":"978-0521736534","pages":"202 pages","publication date":"September 19, 2011","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/7f/7f3687c1852c5cbc4f723589783e2361.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9bp","title":"Graph Algorithms"}
