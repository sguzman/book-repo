{"categories":["Algorithms"],"desc":" Shimon Evenâ€™s Graph Algorithms, published in 1979, was a seminal introductory book on algorithms read by everyone engaged in the field. This thoroughly revised second edition, with a foreword by Richard M. Karp and notes by Andrew V. Goldberg, continues the exceptional presentation from the first edition and explains algorithms in a formal but simple language with a direct and intuitive presentation. The book begins by covering basic material, including graphs and shortest paths, trees, depth-first-search and breadth-first search. The main part of the book is devoted to network flows and applications of network flows, and it ends with chapters on planar graphs and testing graph planarity.","details":{"authors":"Guy Even","format":"pdf","isbn-10":null,"isbn-13":null,"pages":"199 pages","publication date":"September 19, 2011","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/cd/cdec9e45c2b5ef8d0bcd0e1b63373c46.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/a9f","title":"Graph Algorithms"}
