{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Organisations are becoming increasingly concerned about climate change, and are looking for ways to reduce their environmental impact. A brand with a genuine commitment to the green agenda will be more valued by its customers, and cutting energy consumption means that your business can also cut costs. The IT department has a vital role to play in minimising the carbon footprint of your organisation. Green IT in Practice, Second edition provides guidance on how to implement a Green IT programme. It will help you to formulate a Green IT policy, curb demand for data storage capacity, and lower the electricity consumption of the datacentre. A specific chapter looks at how server and desktop virtualisation can enable your business to save energy and space. Based on his first-hand experience of successfully implementing Green IT initiatives for the John Lewis Partnership, the author describes the specific problems that JLP confronted, and explains the solutions that he found for them. He gives a fascinating account of how Green IT has enabled one of Britain’s best-loved companies to make significant improvements in efficiency. This second edition has been updated to reflect the progress that JLP’s Green IT programme has made since 2008. The author shows how IT can be harnessed to help reduce carbon emissions across the whole organisation, pointing to the success of IT initiatives at Waitrose in improving demand forecasting and reducing food miles.","details":{"authors":"IT Governance Publishing","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849280517","isbn-13":"978-1849280518","pages":"128 pages","publication date":"May 27, 2010","publisher":"It Governance Publishing","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/fc/fcbab048275f2263e1ecb2f3e23ad1e4.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/g3q","title":"Green It In Practice"}
