{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This “hands-on” book is for people who are interested in immediately putting Maple to work. The reader is provided with a compact, fast and surveyable guide that introduces them to the extensive capabilities of the software. The book is sufficient for standard use of Maple and will provide techniques for extending Maple for more specialized work. The author discusses the reliability of results systematically and presents ways of testing questionable results. The book allows a reader to become a user almost immediately and helps him/her to grow gradually to a broader and more proficient use. As a consequence, some subjects are dealt with in an introductory way early in the book, with references to a more detailed discussion later on.","details":{"authors":"Ernic Kamerich","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1461264367","isbn-13":"978-1461264361","pages":"325 pages","publication date":"September 8, 2012","publisher":"Springer","size":"10.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/5a/5a2c8005d431b236c9fffd1d2fe342ac.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bt4","title":"A Guide to Maple"}
