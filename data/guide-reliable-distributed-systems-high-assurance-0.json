{"categories":["Cloud Computing","Computer Science","Engineering","Programming"],"desc":" This book describes the key concepts, principles and implementation options for creating high-assurance cloud computing solutions. The guide starts with a broad technical overview and basic introduction to cloud computing, looking at the overall architecture of the cloud, client systems, the modern Internet and cloud computing data centers. It then delves into the core challenges of showing how reliability and fault-tolerance can be abstracted, how the resulting questions can be solved, and how the solutions can be leveraged to create a wide range of practical cloud applications. The authorâ€™s style is practical, and the guide should be readily understandable without any special background. Concrete examples are often drawn from real-world settings to illustrate key insights. Appendices show how the most important reliability models can be formalized, describe the API of the Isis","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1447124154","isbn-13":"978-1447124153","pages":"730 pages","publication date":"January 16, 2012","publisher":"Springer","size":"8.58Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/c4/c4d0024293a3e0ed8e71b0039ca1f1d2.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h8a","title":"Guide to Reliable Distributed Systems: Building High-Assurance Applications and Cloud-Hosted Services (Texts in Computer Science)"}
