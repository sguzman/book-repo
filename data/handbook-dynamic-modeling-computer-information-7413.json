{"categories":["Engineering","Manual"],"desc":" The topic of dynamic models tends to be splintered across various disciplines, making it difficult to uniformly study the subject. Moreover, the models have a variety of representations, from traditional mathematical notations to diagrammatic and immersive depictions. Collecting all of these expressions of dynamic models, the Handbook of Dynamic System Modeling explores a panoply of different types of modeling methods available for dynamical systems.","details":{"authors":"Paul A.
