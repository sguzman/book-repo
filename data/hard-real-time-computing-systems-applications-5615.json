{"categories":["Algorithms","Computing","Engineering","Programming"],"desc":" This updated edition offers an indispensable exposition on real-time computing, with particular emphasis on predictable scheduling algorithms. It introduces the fundamental concepts of real-time computing, demonstrates the most significant results in the field, and provides the essential methodologies for designing predictable computing systems used to support time-critical control applications. Along with an in-depth guide to the available approaches for the implementation and analysis of real-time applications, this revised edition contains a close examination of recent developments in real-time systems, including limited preemptive scheduling, resource reservation techniques, overload handling algorithms, and adaptive scheduling techniques. This volume serves as a fundamental advanced-level textbook. Each chapter provides basic concepts, which are followed by algorithms, illustrated with concrete examples, figures and tables. Exercises and solutions are provided to enhance self-study, making this an excellent reference for those interested in real-time computing for designing and/or developing predictable control applications.","details":{"authors":"Giorgio C Buttazzo","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1461406757","isbn-13":"978-1461406754","pages":"524 pages","publication date":"September 15, 2011","publisher":"Springer","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/c2/c288c25ea2196367a738fc9a975bb084.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/br1","title":"Hard Real-Time Computing Systems: Predictable Scheduling Algorithms and Applications (Real-Time Systems Series)"}
