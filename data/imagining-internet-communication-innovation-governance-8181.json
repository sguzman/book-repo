{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This book is an impressive survey of our collective and cumulative understanding of the evolution of digital communication systems and the Internet. While the information societies of the twenty-first century will develop ever more sophisticated technologies, the Internet is now a familiar and pervasive part of the world in which we live, work, and communicate. As such it is important to take stock of some fundamental questions–whether, for example, it contributes to progress, social cohesion, democracy, and growth–and at the same time to review the rich and varied theories and perspectives developed by thinkers in a range of disciplines over the last fifty years or more.","details":{"authors":"Robin Mansell","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0199697051","isbn-13":"978-0199697052","pages":"296 pages","publication date":"September 8, 2012","publisher":"Oxford University Press","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/5f/5f942caaec504db1b747c9a19aae81f4.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/evv","title":"Imagining the Internet: Communication, Innovation, and Governance"}
