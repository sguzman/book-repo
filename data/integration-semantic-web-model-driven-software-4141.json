{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" The next enterprise computing era will rely on the synergy between both technologies: semantic web and model-driven software development (MDSD). The semantic web organizes system knowledge in conceptual domains according to its meaning. It addresses various enterprise computing needs by identifying, abstracting and rationalizing commonalities, and checking for inconsistencies across system specifications. On the other side, model-driven software development is closing the gap among business requirements, designs and executables by using domain-specific languages with custom-built syntax and semantics. It focuses on using modeling languages as programming languages.","details":{"authors":"Fernando Silva Parreiras","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1118004175","isbn-13":"978-1118004173","pages":"264 pages","publication date":"June 5, 2012","publisher":"Wiley-IEEE Press","size":"6.45Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/90/902c052fb07d75289408da6aad8522d2.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/fo0","title":"Integration of the Semantic Web and Model-Driven Software"}
