{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Courts recognize that those who are involved in medico-legal proceedings have a stake in the outcome of their psychological assessment, regardless of whether they are high- or low-functioning individuals. Accounting for the validity of the evaluation in low-functioning examinees is frequently made more difficult by impairment; when evaluating testimony from people with intellectual disability (ID), neuropsychologists and psychologists must acknowledge the differences between the medico-legal evaluation and the clinical evaluation. This book provides helpful guidelines for assessing validity in low-functioning claimants. It charts recent advances in psychological and neuropsychological assessment pertaining to civil and criminal proceedings while examining issues such as validity and motivation, assessments of disability, criminal and civil capacities, capital cases, Miranda waiver cases, and others.","details":{"authors":"Michael Chafetz","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0199998116","isbn-13":"978-0199998111","pages":"224 pages","publication date":"April 6, 2015","publisher":"Oxford University Press","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/e4/e489c3675698bbcc14667c8d561c3479.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/atc","title":"Intellectual Disability: Criminal and Civil Forensic Issues (AACN Workshop Series)"}
