{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" The book deals with intelligent control of mobile robots, presenting the state-of-the-art in the field, and introducing new control algorithms developed and tested by the authors. It also discusses the use of artificial intelligent methods like neural networks and neuraldynamic programming, including globalised dual-heuristic dynamic programming, for controlling wheeled robots and robotic manipulators,and compares them to classical control methods.","details":{"authors":"Marcin Szuster, Zenon Hendzel","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319688243","isbn-13":"978-3319688244","pages":"382 pages","publication date":"December 28, 2017","publisher":"Springer","size":"17.38Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/2f/2f5a16a7c348de5d1210d727c868710a.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/d8m","title":"Intelligent Optimal Adaptive Control for Mechatronic Systems (Studies in Systems, Decision and Control)"}
