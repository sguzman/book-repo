{"categories":["Engineering","Machine Learning","Networking"],"desc":" This brief monograph is the first one to deal exclusively with the quantitative approximation by artificial neural networks to the identity-unit operator. Here we study with rates the approximation properties of the “right” sigmoidal and hyperbolic tangent artificial neural network positive linear operators. In particular we study the degree of approximation of these operators to the unit operator in the univariate and multivariate cases over bounded or unbounded domains. This is given via inequalities and with the use of modulus of continuity of the involved function or its higher order derivative. We examine the real and complex cases.","details":{"authors":"George A.
