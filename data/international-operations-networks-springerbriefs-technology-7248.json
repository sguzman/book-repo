{"categories":["Engineering","Networking","Web Development"],"desc":" Although the area of International Manufacturing Network (IMN) and International Operations Network (ION) has received considerable attention in the literature, most of studies appear multifaceted and interdisciplinary, and thereby require thorough investigation from both academic and practical perspectives, in order to deepen our related understanding. The book seeks advanced contributions that will combine theoretical insights and empirical experience by offering a detailed examination of IMN and, further, ION from various perspectives. This book can be used as a reference material for scholar-practitioners, business executives, and university researchers who need to deepen their understanding on the importance and influence of IMN and ION as well as their development. The book is important because there are few reference/resource materials available related to IMN and ION.","details":{"authors":"John Johansen, Sami Farooq, Yang Cheng","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1447156455","isbn-13":"978-1447156451","pages":"184 pages","publication date":"July 24, 2014","publisher":"Springer","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/ae/ae0c08da6745a3981d6df8e5557d425b.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ate","title":"International Operations Networks (Springerbriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology)"}
