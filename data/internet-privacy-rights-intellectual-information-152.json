{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Internet Privacy Rights analyses the current threats to our online autonomy and privacy and proposes a new model for the gathering, retention and use of personal data. Key to the model is the development of specific privacy rights: a right to roam the internet with privacy, a right to monitor the monitors, a right to delete personal data and a right to create, assert and protect an online identity. These rights could help in the formulation of more effective and appropriate legislation, and shape more privacy-friendly business models. The conclusion examines how the internet might look with these rights in place and whether such an internet could be sustainable from both a governmental and a business perspective.","details":{"authors":"Paul Bernal","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1107042739","isbn-13":"978-1107042735","pages":"328 pages","publication date":"May 26, 2014","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/44/44614668ae80626863d9dd700b1cc14b.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ea8","title":"Internet Privacy Rights: Rights to Protect Autonomy (Cambridge Intellectual Property and Information Law)"}
