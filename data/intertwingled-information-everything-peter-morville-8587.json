{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This is a book about everything. Or, to be precise, it explores how everything is connected from code to culture. We think we’re designing software, services, and experiences, but we’re not. We are intervening in ecosystems. Until we open our minds, we will forever repeat our mistakes. In this spirited tour of information architecture and systems thinking, Peter Morville connects the dots between authority, Buddhism, classification, synesthesia, quantum entanglement, and volleyball. In 1974 when Ted Nelson wrote “everything is deeply intertwingled,” he hoped we might realize the true potential of hypertext and cognition. This book follows naturally from that.","details":{"authors":"Peter Morville","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0692225587","isbn-13":"978-0692225585","pages":"198 pages","publication date":"August 13, 2014","publisher":"Semantic Studios","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/28/28058743aeda962342bb7db943d58ced.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8n9","title":"Intertwingled: Information Changes Everything"}
