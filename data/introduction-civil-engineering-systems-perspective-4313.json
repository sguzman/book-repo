{"categories":["Engineering","Programming"],"desc":" This book presents an integrated systems approach to the evaluation, analysis, design, and maintenance of civil engineering systems. Addressing recent concerns about the worldâ€™s aging civil infrastructure and its environmental impact, the author makes the case for why any civil infrastructure should be seen as part of a larger whole. He walks readers through all phases of a civil project, from feasibility assessment to construction to operations, explaining how to evaluate tasks and challenges at each phase using a holistic approach. Unique coverage of ethics, legal issues, and management is also included.","details":{"authors":"Samuel Labi","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0470530634","isbn-13":"978-0470530634","pages":"1056 pages","publication date":"April 7, 2014","publisher":"Wiley","size":"39.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/5a/5a2b2f6345429afb7841170099f36eb1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/b0b","title":"Introduction to Civil Engineering Systems: A Systems Perspective to the Development of Civil Engineering Facilities"}
