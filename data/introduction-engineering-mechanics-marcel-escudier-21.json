{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" We inhabit a world of fluids, including air (a gas), water (a liquid), steam (vapour) and the numerous natural and synthetic fluids which are essential to modern-day life. Fluid mechanics concerns the way fluids flow in response to imposed stresses. The subject plays a central role in the education of students of mechanical engineering, as well as chemical engineers, aeronautical and aerospace engineers, and civil engineers. This textbook includes numerous examples of practical applications of the theoretical ideas presented, such as calculating the thrust of a jet engine, the shock- and expansion-wave patterns for supersonic flow over a diamond-shaped aerofoil, the forces created by liquid flow through a pipe bend and/or junction, and the power output of a gas turbine.","details":{"authors":"Marcel Escudier","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0198719876","isbn-13":"978-0198719878","pages":"608 pages","publication date":"January 2, 2018","publisher":"Oxford University Press","size":"19.99Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/5c/5cfec87079ba450b02e5825d5e386339.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/fdq","title":"Introduction to Engineering Fluid Mechanics"}
