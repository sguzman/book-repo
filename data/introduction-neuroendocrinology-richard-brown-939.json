{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Neuroendocrinology is a multidisciplinary subject on the interaction between the brain and endocrine system and the influence of this interaction on the behavior of animals and humans.  This book is designed as an introductory text in neuroendocrinology.  It outlines the basics of endocrinology, including the endocrine glands, the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, and their interactions.   It also describes the action of neurotransmitters in the nervous system, the action of neuropeptides as chemical messengers, and the interaction among hormones, neurotransmitters, and neuropeptides. It also introduces the important new field of neuro-endocrine-immunology and contains a chapter on behavioral neuroendocrinology.  The level of presentation is suitable for undergraduates who have completed introductory biology or psychology classes, and each chapter contains review questions based on material in that chapter and essay questions for further in-depth study.","details":{"authors":"Richard Brown","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521767229","isbn-13":"978-0521426657","pages":"432 pages","publication date":"January 28, 1994","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/12/12cf00eb34d6408600871eccc87d8149.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/av5","title":"An Introduction to Neuroendocrinology"}
