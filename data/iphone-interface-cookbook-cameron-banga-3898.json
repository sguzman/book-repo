{"categories":["Manual"],"desc":" Written in a cookbook style, this book offers solutions using a recipe based approach. Each recipe contains step-by-step instructions followed by an analysis of what was done in each task and other useful information. The cookbook approach means you can dive into whatever recipes you want in no particular order. The iPhone Interface Cookbook is written from the ground up for people who are new to iOS or application interface design in general. Each chapter discusses the reasoning and design strategy behind critical interface components, as well as how to best integrate each into any iPhone or iPad application. Detailed and straight-forward recipes help give guidance and build understanding far beyond what is offered through Appleâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines.","details":{"authors":"Cameron Banga","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849691142","isbn-13":"978-1849691147","pages":"262 pages","publication date":"November 25, 2011","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/fc/fc7c50d4e92c88f3471fc7fcbd7d8e61.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/fk3","title":"iPhone User Interface Cookbook"}
