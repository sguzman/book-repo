{"categories":["Programming","Scripting","Web Development"],"desc":" Now in its sixth edition, JAVASCRIPT guides beginning programmers through web application development using the JavaScript programming language. As with previous editions of the book, the authors introduce key web authoring techniques with a strong focus on industry application. New coverage includes developing for touchscreen and mobile devices, and using the jQuery library. A real-world project, similar to what students would encounter in a professional setting, is developed chapter by chapter. Because professional web development jobs often require programmers to add features to existing sites, each chapter project uses a professionally designed web site. After completing a course using this textbook, students will be able to use JavaScript to build professional quality, dynamic web sites.","details":{"authors":"Don Gosselin","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1305078446","isbn-13":"978-1305078444","pages":"896 pages","publication date":"August 27, 2014","publisher":"Cengage Learning","size":"54.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/2b/2bc0f3556568595bacd9ab8655d2afa1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/b2d","title":"JavaScript: The Web Warrior Series"}
