{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Design research is a hard slog that takes years to learn and time away from the real work of design, right? Wrong. Good research is about asking more and better questions, and thinking critically about the answers. It’s something every member of your team can and should do, and which everyone can learn, quickly. And done well, it will save you time and money by reducing unknowns and creating a solid foundation to build the right thing, in the most effective way. In Just Enough Research, co-founder of Mule Design Erika Hall distills her experience into a brief cookbook of research methods. Learn how to discover your competitive advantages, spot your own blind spots and biases, understand and harness your findings, and why you should never, ever hold a focus group. You’ll start doing good research faster than you can plan your next pitch. Erika Hall has been working in web design and development since the late 20th century. In 2001, she co-founded Mule Design Studio where she directs the research, interaction design, and strategy practices. Erika speaks and writes frequently about cross-disciplinary collaboration and the importance of natural language in user interfaces. In her spare time, she battles empty corporate jargon at Unsuck It. She also co-hosts Running from the Law, a weekly podcast on business law and endurance fitness, and can probably outrun you.","details":{"authors":"Erika Hall","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1937557103","isbn-13":"978-1937557102","pages":"154 pages","publication date":"2013","publisher":"A Book Apart","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/3f/3f9421f45e2f3869aec305161fed60c9.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/afd","title":"Just Enough Research"}
