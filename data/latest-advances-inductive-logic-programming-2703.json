The collection marks two decades since the first ILP workshop in 1991. During this period the area has developed into the main forum for work on logic-based machine learning. The chapters cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from theory and ILP implementations to state-of-the-art applications in real-world domains. The international contributors represent leaders in the field from prestigious institutions in Europe, North America and Asia.
