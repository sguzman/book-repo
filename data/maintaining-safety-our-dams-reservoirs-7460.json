{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Maintaining the Safety of our Dams and Reservoirs covers a wide range of topics which are of direct relevance to all who work with dams and reservoirs, whether in the UK or abroad, be they owners, maintainers, designers or constructors. The changes to the UK s legislative frameworks for dam safety are covered, as are examples of the many environmental factors to be taken into account, not just for the construction of new dams but also for alterations and repairs.  Several papers provide examples of the planning or construction of new dams, while many deal with upgrades and repairs to existing dams, some as the results of unforeseen incidents.","details":{"authors":"British Dam Society (ed), British Dam Society","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0727760343","isbn-13":"978-0727760340","pages":"560 pages","publication date":"August 22, 2014","publisher":"ICE Publishing","size":"65.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/af/af16ddeafac61b15d064fab4d1ce5460.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/a7e","title":"Maintaining the Safety of our Dams and Reservoirs"}
