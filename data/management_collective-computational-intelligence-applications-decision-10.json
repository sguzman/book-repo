{"categories":["Engineering","Machine Learning","Management","Programming"],"desc":" This book presents a selection of recently developed collective and computational intelligence techniques, which it subsequently applies to energy management problems ranging from performance analysis to economic analysis, and from strategic analysis to operational analysis, with didactic numerical examples. As a form of intelligence emerging from the collaboration and competition of individuals, collective and computational intelligence addresses new methodological, theoretical, and practical aspects of complex energy management problems. The book offers an excellent reference guide for practitioners, researchers, lecturers and postgraduate students pursuing research on intelligence in energy management. The contributing authors are recognized researchers in the energy research field.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319756893","isbn-13":"978-3319756899","pages":"554 pages","publication date":"May 11, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"10.31Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/9f/9f7193032196a815048cf16195becbd6.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/em4","title":"Energy Management-Collective and Computational Intelligence with Theory and Applications (Studies in Systems, Decision and Control)"}
