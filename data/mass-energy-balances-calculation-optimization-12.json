{"categories":["Designing","Engineering"],"desc":" This textbook introduces students to mass and energy balances and focuses on basic principles for calculation, design, and optimization as they are applied in industrial processes and equipment. While written primarily for undergraduate programs in chemical, energy, mechanical, and environmental engineering, the book can also be used as a reference by technical staff and design engineers interested who are in, and/or need to have basic knowledge of process engineering calculation. Concepts and techniques presented in this volume are highly relevant within many industrial sectors including manufacturing, oil/gas, green and sustainable energy, and power plant design. Drawing on 15 years of teaching experiences, and with a clear understanding of students’ interests, the authors have adopted a very accessible writing style that includes many examples and additional citations to research resources from the literature, referenced at the ends of chapters.","details":{"authors":"Seyed Ali Ashrafizadeh, Zhongchao Tan","format":"epub","isbn-10":"3319722891","isbn-13":"978-3319722894","pages":"269 pages","publication date":"January 11, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"4.03Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/f4/f445db78acd5a2e22464e628be2134f5.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/drh","title":"Mass and Energy Balances: Basic Principles for Calculation, Design, and Optimization of Macro/Nano Systems (Mechanical Engineering Series)"}
