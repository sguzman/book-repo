{"categories":["Digital Design/Media","Manual"],"desc":" MASTERING AUTOCAD MEP 2010 is the ideal book to provide readers with the skills needed to create construction documents with AutoCAD MEP that are reflective of industry standards and expectations. This book focuses on the rationale and practicality of the AutoCAD MEP process and emphasizes the process of creating projects in MEP, rather than a series of independent commands and tools. Tools are introduced together in a focused process, with a strong emphasis on “why” as well as “how”. Both the book and the exercises will provide readers with a clear sense of the value of the tools and a clear indication of each tool’s potential. MASTERING AUTOCAD 2010 MEP is a resource designed to shorten readers’ learning curve, raise their comfort level and, most importantly, give them real life tested practical advice on using the software to create mechanical, electrical and plumbing designs and calculations.","details":{"authors":"Darryl McClelland, Martin J.
