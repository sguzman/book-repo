{"categories":["Data Management","Manual","Web Development"],"desc":" A major limitation of conventional web sites is their unorganized and isolated contents, which is created mainly for human consumption. This limitation can be addressed by organizing and publishing data, using powerful formats that add structure and meaning to the content of web pages and link related data to one another. Computers can “understand” such data better, which can be useful for task automation. The web sites that provide semantics (meaning) to software agents form the Semantic Web, the Artificial Intelligence extension of the World Wide Web. In contrast to the conventional Web (the “Web of Documents”), the Semantic Web includes the “Web of Data”, which connects “things” (representing real-world humans and objects) rather than documents meaningless to computers.
