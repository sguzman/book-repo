{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" There are a large number of books available on fuel cells; however, the majority are on specific types of fuel cells such as solid oxide fuel cells, proton exchange membrane fuel cells, or on specific technical aspects of fuel cells, e.g., the system or stack engineering. Thus, there is a need for a book focused on materials requirements in fuel cells. Key Materials in Low-Temperature Fuel Cells is a concise source of the most important and key materials and catalysts in low-temperature fuel cells. A related book will cover key materials in high-temperature fuel cells. The two books form part of the “Materials for Sustainable Energy & Development” series.","details":{"authors":"San Ping Jiang, Yushan Yan, Max Lu","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3527330429","isbn-13":"978-3527330423","pages":"272 pages","publication date":"March 9, 2015","publisher":"Wiley-VCH","size":"7.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b4/b4098eee05658d73cfdab42810bd1d87.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ary","title":"Materials for Low-Temperature Fuel Cells (New Materials for Sustainable Energy and Development)"}
