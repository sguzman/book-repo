{"categories":["Engineering","Programming","Signal Processing"],"desc":" In recent decades, the study of signal processing has become increasingly complex, with new techniques and applications constantly being developed for the processing, transformation, and interpretation of signals. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the traditional and modern methods used in signal processing. It is designed to impart to the reader the mathematical techniques used in modelling signals and systems, encompassing standard mathematical tools as well as newer techniques such as wavelets and neural networks. C++ and Java implementations furnish these descriptions. The book offers an excellent balance of theory and application, beginning with a complete framework of discrete-time signal processing.","details":{"authors":"Willi-Hans Steeb","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9812565000","isbn-13":"978-9812565006","pages":"296 pages","publication date":"September 2005","publisher":"World Scientific Publishing Company","size":"0.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/48/48a5889cab4d49e0373f88691a668c0e.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/7vt","title":"Mathematical Tools in Signal Processing with C++ and Java Simulations"}
