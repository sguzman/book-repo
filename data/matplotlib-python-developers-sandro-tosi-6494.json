{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" This is a practical, hands-on book, with a lot of code and images. It presents the real code that generates every image and describes almost every single line of it, so that you know exactly whatâ€™s going on. Introductory, descriptive, and theoretical parts are mixed with examples, so that reading and understanding them is easy. All of the examples build gradually with code snippets, their explanations, and plot images where necessary with the complete code and output presented at the end. This book is essentially for Python developers who have a good knowledge of Python; no knowledge of Matplotlib is required. You will be creating 2D plots using Matplotlib in no time at all.","details":{"authors":"Sandro Tosi","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847197906","isbn-13":"978-1847197900","pages":"308 pages","publication date":"November 12, 2009","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"12.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/e2/e26dcbca822b8a0445073e477bc5aa80.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8xm","title":"Matplotlib for Python Developers"}
