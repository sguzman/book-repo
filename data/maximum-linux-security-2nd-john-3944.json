{"categories":["Linux","Operating Systems","Security","Sysadmin"],"desc":" Maximum Linux Security helps Linux administrators identify and plug security holes on their systems by detailing Linux system holes, attack methods, and hackerâ€™s tools that hackers have had years to study, explore, and improve upon. As Linux continues to become more and more mainstream, network administrators will need to know all about the weaknesses in Linux systems that hackers and crackers have had years to learn and explore. Maximum Linux Security provides a crash course on the vulnerabilities of Linux systems, and how to protect these systems from outside attacks. Written from the same hacker perspective as Maximum Security, this book contains everything the Linux network administrator needs to know about protecting his or her systems. This edition of the book has been revised, expanded, and updated to cover the latest advances in Linux hacking tools and techniques, and to more thoroughly cover firewalls, intrusion detection, Linux graphical environments, and routers.","details":{"authors":"John Ray, Anonymous","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0672321343","isbn-13":"978-0672321344","pages":"896 pages","publication date":"June 21, 2001","publisher":"Sams","size":"10.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/d9/d94bb9e8478d3af36d9d7351023bb752.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/cnx","title":"Maximum Linux Security (2nd Edition)"}
