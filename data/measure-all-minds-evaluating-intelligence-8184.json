{"categories":["Machine Learning","Programming"],"desc":" Are psychometric tests valid for a new reality of artificial intelligence systems, technology-enhanced humans, and hybrids yet to come? Are the Turing Test, the ubiquitous CAPTCHAs, and the various animal cognition tests the best alternatives? In this fascinating and provocative book, José Hernández-Orallo formulates major scientific questions, integrates the most significant research developments, and offers a vision of the universal evaluation of cognition. By replacing the dominant anthropocentric stance with a universal perspective where living organisms are considered as a special case, long-standing questions in the evaluation of behavior can be addressed in a wider landscape. Can we derive task difficulty intrinsically? Is a universal g factor – a common general component for all abilities – theoretically possible? Using algorithmic information theory as a foundation, the book elaborates on the evaluation of perceptual, developmental, social, verbal and collective features and critically analyzes what the future of intelligence might look like.","details":{"authors":"José Hernández-Orallo","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1107153018","isbn-13":"978-1107153011","pages":"558 pages","publication date":"January 11, 2017","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"11.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/86/86fbf24f45b8213868965a14558c6133.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9xi","title":"The Measure of All Minds: Evaluating Natural and Artificial Intelligence"}
