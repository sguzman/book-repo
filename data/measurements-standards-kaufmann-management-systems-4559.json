{"categories":["Data Management","Databases","Engineering","Management"],"desc":" Joe Celko has looked deep into the code of SQL programmers and found a consistent and troubling pattern – a frightening lack of consistency between their individual encoding schemes and those of the industries in which they operate.

Such incompatibility severely hinders information flow and the quality of company data.","details":{"authors":"Joe Celko","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0123747228","isbn-13":"978-0123747228","pages":"309 pages","publication date":"October 1, 2009","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/58/5827d5a48e612a56b12791541722769e.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8y3","title":"Joe Celko’s Data, Measurements and Standards in SQL (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)"}
