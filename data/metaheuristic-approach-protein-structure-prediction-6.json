{"categories":["Algorithms","Engineering"],"desc":" This book introduces characteristic features of the protein structure prediction (PSP) problem. It focuses on systematic selection and improvement of the most appropriate metaheuristic algorithm to solve the problem based on a fitness landscape analysis, rather than on the nature of the problem, which was the focus of methodologies in the past.","details":{"authors":"Nanda Dulal Jana, Swagatam Das, Jaya Sil","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319747746","isbn-13":"978-3319747743","pages":"220 pages","publication date":"March 6, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"8.20Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/17/17ea0bcf880a8164f0ee35825671a7e9.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/fb4","title":"A Metaheuristic Approach to Protein Structure Prediction: Algorithms and Insights from Fitness Landscape Analysis (Emergence, Complexity and Computation)"}
