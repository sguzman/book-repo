{"categories":["Cloud Computing","Programming","Software"],"desc":" This fast-paced guide enables developers to design and build Enterprise applications for the cloud. You will find it easy to follow this book, as the authors use an actual online portal application for the case study. Throughout the development of the sample application there is discussion of important considerations for moving an application into the cloud. If you provide technological leadership to your enterprise – senior developers, architects, CIO/CTO – and you want or need to guide your enterprise’s application design to Azure, this is the perfect book for you! Since the examples are in .NET, the book will skew to MS-oriented developers. But a lot of what is discussed will be applicable to anyone wanting to work with Azure. No matter what language you use, you provision the application fabric the same way, and all the underlying concepts will be the same. You will need experience with Visual Studio, and some basic SQL Server knowledge.","details":{"authors":"Richard J.
