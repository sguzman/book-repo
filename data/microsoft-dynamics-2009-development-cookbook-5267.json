{"categories":["Manual","Programming","Software"],"desc":" This book contains a list of useful Dynamics AX modifications – recipes – along with all required code and in-depth explanations. Most of the recipes are presented using real-world examples in a variety of Dynamics AX modules. The step-by-step instructions along with many useful screenshots make learning easier. This book is for Dynamics AX developers, and is primarily focused on delivering time-proven application modifications. Although new X++ developers could use this book along with their beginner guides, this book is focused more on people who are willing to raise their programming skills above the beginner level, and at the same time learn the functional aspects of Dynamics AX. So, some Dynamics AX coding experience is expected.","details":{"authors":"Mindaugas Pocius","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847199429","isbn-13":"978-1847199423","pages":"352 pages","publication date":"December 16, 2009","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b8/b85bbf172703a243867e0c137ae19fe4.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8qg","title":"Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 Development Cookbook"}
