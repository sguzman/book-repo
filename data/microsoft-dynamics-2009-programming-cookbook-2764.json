{"categories":["Manual","Programming","Software"],"desc":" You won’t find any fluff here. This book is written in a direct, to-the-point style to help you get what you need and continue working in NAV. At the same time it provides enough explanation so that you understand what we are doing and why it is necessary. In many programming books you will find yourself searching through paragraph after paragraph to try to find what you are looking for. That’s not the case here. Each recipe starts with a short description of what it will teach. It is immediately followed with directions, usually with illustrations, of how to perform the task. You will find the explanation of the code at the end, along with some advice for further reading or other tasks you might be interested in. If you are a junior / entry-level NAV developer then the first half of the book is designed primarily for you. You may or may not have any experience programming. It focuses on the basics of NAV programming. It would be best if you have gone through a brief introduction to the NAV client. If you are a mid-level NAV developer, you will find the second half more useful. These chapters explain how to think outside of the NAV box when building solutions. There are also recipes here and there that senior developers will find useful.","details":{"authors":"Matt Traxinger","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849680949","isbn-13":"978-1849680943","pages":"356 pages","publication date":"October 20, 2010","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"9.65Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/f2/f27470dd8368f8d207d5e067213cf828.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/be1","title":"Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 Programming Cookbook"}
