{"categories":["Manual","Operating Systems","Software"],"desc":" This is a fast-paced and to-the-point handbook, it takes you through the important aspects that you need to know when working with Windows WF. The range of topics that we cover in this book is driven by what the working developer needs to know. It is neither a comprehensive reference to the whole WF architecture, nor a strategic guide to the complete application development lifecycle. If you find yourself working with Windows Workflow Foundation 4.0 and you have basic knowledge of C#/.NET Framework/ VB and workflow, this book is for you. It will be best if you know both C# and VB, because WF 4.0 expression can only be written in VB (at the time of writing). With this book, you will be able to enhance your applications with flexible workflow capabilities using WF 4.0. To follow the recipes, you will need to be comfortable with .NET Framework, C# programming, basics of SOA, and how to develop them.","details":{"authors":"Andrew Zhu","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849680787","isbn-13":"978-1849680783","pages":"272 pages","publication date":"September 24, 2010","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"6.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/6d/6dbdbca735d8b0e86b12f5d90737a5ef.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dm2","title":"Microsoft Windows Workflow Foundation 4.0 Cookbook"}
