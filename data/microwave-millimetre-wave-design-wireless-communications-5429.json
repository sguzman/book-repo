{"categories":["Designing","Telecommunications"],"desc":" This book describes a full range of contemporary techniques for the design of transmitters and receivers for communications systems operating in the range from 1 through to 300 GHz. In this frequency range there is a wide range of technologies that need to be employed, with silicon ICs at the core but, compared with other electronics systems, a much greater use of more specialist devices and components for high performance – for example, high Q-factor/low loss and good power efficiency. Many text books do, of course, cover these topics but what makes this book timely is the rapid adoption of millimetre-waves (frequencies from 30 to 300 GHz) for a wide range of consumer applications such as wireless high definition TV, “5G” Gigabit mobile internet systems and automotive radars.  It has taken many years to develop low-cost technologies for suitable transmitters and receivers, so previously these frequencies have been employed only in expensive military and space applications. The book will cover these modern technologies, with the follow topics covered;  transmitters and receivers, lumped element filters, tranmission lines and S-parameters, RF MEMS, RFICs and MMICs, and many others.","details":{"authors":"Ian Robertson, Nutapong Somjit, Mitchai Chongcheawchamnan","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1118917219","isbn-13":"978-1118917213","pages":"608 pages","publication date":"August 29, 2016","publisher":"Wiley","size":"31.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/87/87c896d22a52226375da784f9f66f2c7.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/asx","title":"Microwave and Millimetre-Wave Design for Wireless Communications"}
