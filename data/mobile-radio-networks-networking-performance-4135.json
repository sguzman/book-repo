{"categories":["Mobile Development","Networking"],"desc":" Offers a comprehensive and detailed description of services and protocols of the systems. Particular attention is paid to the radio-related specifics required for establishment of a mobile communication system. All systems described have been implemented during research for analysis of their performance by event driven stochastic simulation under typical traffic loads. Consequently the similarities and differences between systems are described clearly and coherently.","details":{"authors":"Bernhard H.
