{"categories":["Computer Science","Computing","Engineering"],"desc":" This engaging text presents the fundamental mathematics and modelling techniques for computing systems in a novel and light-hearted way, which can be easily followed by students at the very beginning of their university education. Key concepts are taught through a large collection of challenging yet fun mathematical games and logical puzzles that require no prior knowledge about computers. The text begins with intuition and examples as a basis from which precise concepts are then developed; demonstrating how, by working within the confines of a precise structured method, the occurrence of errors in the system can be drastically reduced.Â ","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1848003218","isbn-13":"978-1848003217","pages":"500 pages","publication date":"July 12, 2013","publisher":"Springer","size":"3.93Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/8f/8fbb351df922888460114655a80fa1b1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ert","title":"Modelling Computing Systems: Mathematics for Computer Science (Undergraduate Topics in Computer Science)"}
