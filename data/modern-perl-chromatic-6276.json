{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" The Best Perl Programmers Use Modern Perl In 1987, Perl 1.0 changed the world. In the decades since then, the language has grown from a simple tool for system administration somewhere between shell scripting and C programming to a powerful, general purpose language steeped in a rich heritage. Even so, most Perl 5 programs in the world take far too little advantage of the language. You can write Perl 5 programs as if they were Perl 4 programs (or Perl 3 or 2 or 1), but programs written to take advantage of everything amazing the worldwide Perl 5 community has invented, polished, and discovered are shorter, faster, more powerful, and easier to maintain than their alternatives. They solve difficult problems with speed and elegance. They take advantage of the CPAN and its unparalleled library of reusable code. They get things done. This productivity can be yours, whether you’ve dabbled with Perl for a decade or someone just handed you this book and said “Fix this code by Friday.” Modern Perl is suitable for programmers of every level. It’s more than a Perl tutorial-only Modern Perl focuses on Perl 5.12 and 5.14, to demonstrate the latest and most effective time-saving features. Only Modern Perl explains how and why the language works, to let you unlock the full power of Perl. Hone your skills. Sharpen your knowledge of the tools and techniques that make Perl so effective. Master everything Perl has to offer. When you have to solve a problem now, reach for Perl. When you have to solve a problem right, reach for Modern Perl.","details":{"authors":"Chromatic","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0977920178","isbn-13":"978-0977920174","pages":"290 pages","publication date":"December 7, 2011","publisher":"Onyx Neon Press","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/7d/7d20caf79959d42e200b603b48893caa.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/85s","title":"Modern Perl"}
