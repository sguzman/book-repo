{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" The book presents the reader with clear instructions for setting up specific activities, based around an example maths course (Pythagorean Theorem) with plenty of examples and screenshots. No Moodle experience is required to use the book, but the book will focus only on activities and modules relevant to teaching mathematics. We will assume that the reader has access to a working installation of Moodle. The activities will be appropriate for teaching math in high schools and universities. The book is aimed at math teachers who want to use Moodle to deliver or support their teaching. The book will also be useful for teachers of “mathematical sciences”, or courses with a significant mathematical content that will benefit from the use of some of the tools explored in the book.","details":{"authors":"Ian Wild","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847196446","isbn-13":"978-1847196446","pages":"276 pages","publication date":"November 23, 2009","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"12.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/3d/3d416ab20f847e863e5de09632ffc7d3.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/fqj","title":"Moodle 1.9 Math"}
