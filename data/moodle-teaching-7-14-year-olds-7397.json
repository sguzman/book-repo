{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" This book is part of Packt’s Beginner’s Guide series. Written in a friendly tone, the book starts at the very beginning with a blank Moodle page and you are taken step by step through the most useful features of Moodle, helped with many illustrative screenshots. The chapters gradually build up your skills and by the end of the book you will be confident enough to design a fully functional, interactive course for 7-14 year olds. This book is for regular, non-technical teachers of pre-teen or early teenage children. It assumes no prior knowledge of Moodle and no particular expertise on the Web. Classroom assistants may also find this book a very useful resource.","details":{"authors":"Mary Cooch","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847197140","isbn-13":"978-1847197146","pages":"236 pages","publication date":"March 26, 2009","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/d5/d54081f498f934beeed900b92de6eacf.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/fwq","title":"Moodle 1.9 for Teaching 7-14 Year Olds: Beginner’s Guide"}
