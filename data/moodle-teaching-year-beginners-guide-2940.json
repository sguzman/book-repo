{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" Part of Packt’s Beginner’s Guide series, this book will steadily guide the reader through exercises using practical examples that are easy to build, which are illustrated with screenshots. The activities become steadily more sophisticated and include combining the content from one module with another. This book is aimed at teachers of children aged 4 to 9 who wish to integrate the Moodle open source virtual learning environment into their teaching. It assumes a basic knowledge of the Web but no prior knowledge of Moodle, although it is expected that you will either have Moodle already set up in your school, or a friendly IT technician who can do it for you.","details":{"authors":"Nicholas Freear","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849513287","isbn-13":"978-1849513289","pages":"332 pages","publication date":"October 24, 2011","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"32.54Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/35/3597c94a2339400effc632ae8cf06a2d.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/g6k","title":"Moodle 2 for Teaching 4-9 Year Olds Beginner’s Guide"}
