{"categories":["Engineering","Telecommunications"],"desc":" The technological progress in multi-carrier (MC) modulation led orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to become an important part of beyond 3G cellular mobile communication standards, including LTE and WiMAX. In addition, the flexibility offered by the spread spectrum (SS) and time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques motivated many researchers to investigate several MC combined multiple access schemes, such as MC-CDMA, OFDMA and MC-TDMA. These schemes benefit from the advantages of each sub-system and offer high flexibility, high spectral efficiency, simple detection strategies and narrow-band interference rejection capability.
