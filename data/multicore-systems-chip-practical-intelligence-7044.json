{"categories":["Designing","Engineering","Hardware","Machine Learning"],"desc":" Conventional on-chip communication design mostly use ad-hoc approaches that fail to meet the challenges posed by the next-generation MultiCore Systems on-chip (MCSoC) designs. These major challenges include wiring delay, predictability, diverse interconnection architectures, and power dissipation. A Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm is emerging as the solution for the problems of interconnecting dozens of cores into a single system on-chip. However, there are many problems associated with the design of such systems. These problems arise from non-scalable global wire delays, failure to achieve global synchronization, and difficulties associated with non-scalable bus-based functional interconnects.
