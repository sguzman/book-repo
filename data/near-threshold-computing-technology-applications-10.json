{"categories":["Computing","Programming"],"desc":" This book explores near-threshold computing (NTC), a design-space using techniques to run digital chips (processors) near the lowest possible voltage. Readers will be enabled with specific techniques to design chips that are extremely robust; tolerating variability and resilient against errors. Variability-aware voltage and frequency allocation schemes will be presented that will provide performance guarantees, when moving toward near-threshold manycore chips.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"epub","isbn-10":"3319233882","isbn-13":"978-3319233888","pages":"100 pages","publication date":"November 14, 2015","publisher":"Springer","size":"2.16Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/c6/c6994e1d2ded55dabc3f5fce03034559.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h54","title":"Near Threshold Computing: Technology, Methods and Applications"}
