An organization is only as strong as its weakest link. The same is true in network security. Mis-configurations, outdated software and technical glitches are often the easiest point of entry for a hacker. This book, the third in the series, is designed to teach the potential security practitioner how to harden the network infrastructure, evaluate hardware and software configurations and introduce log analysis, creating a strong foundation for Network Security Troubleshooting, response, and repair.","details":{"authors":"EC-Council","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"143548357X","isbn-13":"978-1435483576","pages":"176 pages","publication date":"April 12, 2010","publisher":"Cengage Learning","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/4f/4f4df9d3bb0b29c83c1110c17a760fc3.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8w7","title":"Network Defense: Perimeter Defense Mechanisms (EC-Council Press)"}
