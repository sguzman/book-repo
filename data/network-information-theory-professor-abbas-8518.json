{"categories":["Computer Science","Networking"],"desc":" This comprehensive treatment of network information theory and its applications provides the first unified coverage of both classical and recent results. With an approach that balances the introduction of new models and new coding techniques, readers are guided through Shannonâ€™s point-to-point information theory, single-hop networks, multihop networks, and extensions to distributed computing, secrecy, wireless communication, and networking. Elementary mathematical tools and techniques are used throughout, requiring only basic knowledge of probability, whilst unified proofs of coding theorems are based on a few simple lemmas, making the text accessible to newcomers. Key topics covered include successive cancellation and superposition coding, MIMO wireless communication, network coding, and cooperative relaying. Also covered are feedback and interactive communication, capacity approximations and scaling laws, and asynchronous and random access channels. This book is ideal for use in the classroom, for self-study, and as a reference for researchers and engineers in industry and academia.","details":{"authors":"Professor Abbas El Gamal, Young-Han Kim","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1107008735","isbn-13":"978-1107008731","pages":"714 pages","publication date":"January 16, 2012","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/c9/c9ae45ab3ede90b9e576b0d759b22445.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8nz","title":"Network Information Theory"}
