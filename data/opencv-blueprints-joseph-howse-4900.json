{"categories":["Image Processing","Machine Learning"],"desc":" Expand your knowledge of computer vision by building amazing projects with OpenCV 3 About This Book Build computer vision projects to capture high-quality image data, detect and track objects, process the actions of humans or animals, and much more Discover practical and interesting innovations in computer vision while building atop a mature open-source library, OpenCV 3 Familiarize yourself with multiple approaches and theories wherever critical decisions need to be made Who This Book Is For This book is ideal for you if you aspire to build computer vision systems that are smarter, faster, more complex, and more practical than the competition. This is an advanced book intended for those who already have some experience in setting up an OpenCV development environment and building applications with OpenCV. You should be comfortable with computer vision concepts, object-oriented programming, graphics programming, IDEs, and the command line. What You Will Learn Select and configure camera systems to see invisible light, fast motion, and distant objects Build a “camera trap”, as used by nature photographers, and process photos to create beautiful effects Develop a facial expression recognition system with various feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods Build a panorama Android application using the OpenCV stitching module in C++ with NDK support Optimize your object detection model, make it rotation invariant, and apply scene-specific constraints to make it faster and more robust Create a person identification and registration system based on biometric properties of that person, such as their fingerprint, iris, and face Fuse data from videos and gyroscopes to stabilize videos shot from your mobile phone and create hyperlapse style videos In Detail Computer vision is becoming accessible to a large audience of software developers who can leverage mature libraries such as OpenCV.
