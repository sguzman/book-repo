{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Written with a fast-paced but friendly and engaging approach, this Packt Beginner’s Guide is designed to be placed alongside the computer as your guide and mentor. Step-by-step tutorials are bolstered by explanations of the reasoning behind what you are doing. You will quickly pick up the necessary skills, tips, and tricks for creating successful 3D graphics with practical examples that help you to learn by experiment and play. This book is intended for software developers who are new to OpenSceneGraph and considering using it in their applications. It is assumed that you have basic knowledge of C++ before using this book, especially the standard template library (STL) constructs, of which OSG makes extensive use. Some familiarity with design patterns as implemented in C++ is also useful, but is not required. You need to be familiar with OpenGL, the standard cross-platform low-level 3D graphics API. We’ll meet some maths in the bookgeometry and linear algebraand familiarity with these topics will be great, but you don’t need to be a maths whiz to use this book.","details":{"authors":"Rui Wang, Xuelei Qian","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849512825","isbn-13":"978-1849512824","pages":"412 pages","publication date":"December 14, 2010","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"20.19Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/95/95850a9ec0d2c2416f9d5f2b30526b80.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/g2q","title":"OpenSceneGraph 3.0: Beginner’s Guide"}
