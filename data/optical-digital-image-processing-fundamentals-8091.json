{"categories":["Image Processing","Programming"],"desc":" In recent years, Moore’s law has fostered the steady growth of the field of digital image processing, though the computational complexity remains a problem for most of the digital image processing applications. In parallel, the research domain of optical image processing has matured, potentially bypassing the problems digital approaches were suffering and bringing new applications. The advancement of technology calls for applications and knowledge at the intersection of both areas but there is a clear knowledge gap between the digital signal processing and the optical processing communities. This book covers the fundamental basis of the optical and image processing techniques by integrating contributions from both optical and digital research communities to solve current application bottlenecks, and give rise to new applications and solutions. Besides focusing on joint research, it also aims at disseminating the knowledge existing in both domains. Applications covered include image restoration, medical imaging, surveillance, holography, etc…","details":{"authors":"Gabriel Cristobal, Peter Schelkens, Hugo Thienpont","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3527409564","isbn-13":"978-3527409563","pages":"988 pages","publication date":"June 7, 2011","publisher":"Wiley-VCH","size":"11.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/2a/2a6fd57f1cc79a09152d446abd1c2e6c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/7vi","title":"Optical and Digital Image Processing: Fundamentals and Applications"}
