{"categories":["Data Management"],"desc":" This book provides a global review of optical satellite image and data compression theories, algorithms, and system implementations. Consisting of nine chapters, it describes a variety of lossless and near-lossless data-compression techniques and three international satellite-data-compression standards. The author shares his firsthand experience and research results in developing novel satellite-data-compression techniques for both onboard and on-ground use, user assessments of the impact that data compression has on satellite data applications, building hardware compression systems, and optimizing and deploying systems. Written with both postgraduate students and advanced professionals in mind, this handbook addresses important issues of satellite data compression and implementation, and it presents an end-to-end treatment of data compression technology.","details":{"authors":"Shen-en Qian","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0819497878","isbn-13":"978-0819497871","pages":"416 pages","publication date":"November 18, 2013","publisher":"SPIE Press","size":"24.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/c9/c9c34f5940776af4faff4a7d087b7449.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/eve","title":"Optical Satellite Data Compression and Implementation (PM241)"}
