{"categories":["Machine Learning"],"desc":" This practical and authoritative text/reference presents a broad introduction to the optimization methods used specifically in computer vision. In order to facilitate understanding, the presentation of the methods is supplemented by simple flow charts, followed by pseudocode implementations that reveal deeper insights into their mode of operation. These discussions are further supported by examples taken from important applications in computer vision. Topics and features: provides a comprehensive overview of computer vision-related optimization; covers a range of techniques from classical iterative multidimensional optimization to cutting-edge topics of graph cuts and GPU-suited total variation-based optimization; describes in detail the optimization methods employed in computer vision applications; illuminates key concepts with clearly written and step-by-step explanations; presents detailed information on implementation, including pseudocode for most methods.","details":{"authors":"Marco Alexander Treiber","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1447152824","isbn-13":"978-1447152828","pages":"257 pages","publication date":"July 15, 2013","publisher":"Springer","size":"6.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b1/b1c5ba31dcf45756ef6ee9a651e4f96c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/byx","title":"Optimization for Computer Vision: An Introduction to Core Concepts and Methods (Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)"}
