{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" Optimization in Practice with MATLAB® provides a unique approach to optimization education. It is accessible to both junior and senior undergraduate and graduate students, as well as industry practitioners. It provides a strongly practical perspective that allows the student to be ready to use optimization in the workplace. It covers traditional materials, as well as important topics previously unavailable in optimization books (e.g., Numerical Essentials – for successful optimization). Written with both the reader and the instructor in mind, Optimization in Practice with MATLAB® provides practical applications of real-world problems using MATLAB®, with a suite of practical examples and exercises that help the students link the theoretical, the analytical, and the computational in each chapter. Additionally, supporting MATLAB® m-files are available for download via www.cambridge.org.messac. Lastly, adopting instructors will receive a comprehensive solution manual with solution codes along with lectures in PowerPoint with animations for each chapter, and the text’s unique flexibility enables instructors to structure one- or two-semester courses.","details":{"authors":"Achille Messac","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1107109183","isbn-13":"978-1107109186","pages":"494 pages","publication date":"March 23, 2015","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"10.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/6e/6e94d03559aeaaa3198d3ca625caf939.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bx3","title":"Optimization in Practice with MATLAB®: For Engineering Students and Professionals"}
