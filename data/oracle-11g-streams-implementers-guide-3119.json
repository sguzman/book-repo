{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This book has a tutorial approach that provides both theoretical explanations and practical step-by-step examples using familiar Oracle demo schemas. Step-by-step examples include use of both Enterprise Manager and the SQLPLUS command-line interface. The authors have combined their experiences of working with customers in Oracle Support, Oracle training and education, and Oracle consulting, to identify the most common areas of confusion and misinterpretation experienced by Oracle Streams users. This book highlights these areas and focuses on bringing clarity and understanding to the reader. This book is for users who have implemented,or are about to implement,a distributed database environment using Oracle Streams replication. The reader is expected to have an intermediate understanding of Oracle database technology.
