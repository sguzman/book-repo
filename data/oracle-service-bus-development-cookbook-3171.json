{"categories":["Manual","Programming"],"desc":" This cookbook is full of immediately useable recipes showing you how to develop service and message-oriented (integration) applications on the Oracle Service Bus. In addition to its cookbook style, which ensures the solutions are presented in a clear step-by-step manner, the explanations go into great detail, which makes it good learning material for everyone who has experience in OSB and wants to improve. Most of the recipes are designed in such a way that each recipe is presented as a separate, standalone entity and reading of prior recipes is not required. The finished solution of each recipe is also made available electronically. If you are an intermediate SOA developer who is using Oracle Service Bus to develop service and message-orientated applications on the Oracle Service Bus, then this book is for you. This book assumes that you have a working knowledge of fundamental SOA concepts and Oracle Service Bus.","details":{"authors":"Guido Schmutz, Edwin Biemond, Jan van Zoggel, Mischa KÃ¶lliker, Eric Elzinga","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849684448","isbn-13":"978-1849684446","pages":"522 pages","publication date":"January 24, 2012","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"10.34Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/e2/e2039789a0f4188af456fb5850aec81e.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/g2s","title":"Oracle Service Bus 11g Development Cookbook"}
