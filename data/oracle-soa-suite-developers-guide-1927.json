{"categories":["Designing","Programming"],"desc":" This book is a comprehensive guide, split into three sections. The initial section of the book provides an introduction to the Oracle SOA Suite and its various components, and will give you a fast-paced hands-on introduction to each of the key components in turn. The next section illustrates the usage of the various components of the SOA Suite to implement a real-world SOA-based solution with the help of an example of an online auction site (oBay). The final section covers other considerations such as the packaging, deployment, testing, security, and administration of SOA applications. This book targets developers and technical architects who work in the SOA domain. The primary purpose of the book is to provide them with a “hands on” practical guide to using and applying the Oracle SOA Suite in the delivery of real-world composite applications. It presumes basic understanding of the concepts of SOA, as well as some of the key standards in this space, including web services (SOAP, WSDL), XML Schemas, and XSLT (and XPath).","details":{"authors":"Matt Wright, Antony Reynolds","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847193552","isbn-13":"978-1847193551","pages":"652 pages","publication date":"March 18, 2009","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"17.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/44/44e5253e8941a6981b374188d288291e.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8ks","title":"Oracle SOA Suite Developer’s Guide"}
