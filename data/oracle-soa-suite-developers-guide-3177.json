{"categories":["Designing","Programming"],"desc":" This book is a comprehensive guide, split into three sections. The initial section of the book provides an introduction to the Oracle SOA Suite and its various components, and will give you an in-depth fast-paced hands-on introduction to each of the key components. The next section provides an in-depth best-practice guide to applying the various components of the SOA Suite to implement a real-world SOA-based solution; it illustrates this through the development of an auction site (oBay). The final section covers other considerations such as the packaging, deployment, testing, security, and administration of SOA applications. If you are a developer or a technical architect who works in the SOA domain, this book is for you. The primary purpose of the book is to provide you with a hands-on practical guide to using and applying the Oracle SOA Suite in the delivery of real-world composite applications. You need basic understanding of the concepts of SOA, as well as some of the key standards in this field, including web services (SOAP, WSDL), XML Schemas, and XSLT (and XPath).","details":{"authors":"Matt Wright, Antony Reynolds","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849680183","isbn-13":"978-1849680189","pages":"720 pages","publication date":"July 2010","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"15.83Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/25/25ab2c00ced171c7ca1fea18715a993f.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8kw","title":"Oracle SOA Suite 11g R1 Developerâ€™s Guide"}
