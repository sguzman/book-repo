{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This book provides a practical tutorial on UPKâ€™s functionality, with the aim of teaching developers how to best leverage this functionality to develop high-quality training material. The book guides readers from the basics of recording through to adding value through Web Pages Packages (Infoblocks), Role filters, Glossaries, and more. The book starts with the recording of a simple simulation, and builds on this recording throughout, by introducing new UPK features and incorporating the lessons learned into this recording. Interwoven into this, the key tasks (how-tos) are formatted in such a way that they can be quickly identified and referred to, making this book useful as an ongoing reference to UPK functionality. This book has been written primarily for new or intermediate training developers who will be using Oracle UPK or OnDemand to create their training material. If you are an experienced UPK developer who wants to tailor UPK to meet your own, specific requirements, you will love this book.","details":{"authors":"Dirk Manuel","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849680167","isbn-13":"978-1849680165","pages":"540 pages","publication date":"September 23, 2009","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"18.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/4e/4ec13d0e69fda509c942ea57ad12a2d2.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/e1p","title":"Oracle User Productivity Kit 3.5"}
