{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" Serving both as an introduction to the subject and as a reference, this book presents the theory in elegant form and with modern concepts and notation. It covers the general theory and emphasizes the classical types of orthogonal polynomials whose weight functions are supported on standard domains. The approach is a blend of classical analysis and symmetry group theoretic methods. Finite reflection groups are used to motivate and classify symmetries of weight functions and the associated polynomials. This revised edition has been updated throughout to reflect recent developments in the field. It contains 25% new material, including two brand new chapters on orthogonal polynomials in two variables, which will be especially useful for applications, and orthogonal polynomials on the unit sphere. The most modern and complete treatment of the subject available, it will be useful to a wide audience of mathematicians and applied scientists, including physicists, chemists and engineers.","details":{"authors":"Yuan Xu","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1107071895","isbn-13":"978-1107071896","pages":"426 pages","publication date":"October 20, 2014","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/49/49d2e90b71702333c71c67d8be1e2820.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/chm","title":"Orthogonal Polynomials of Several Variables (Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications)"}
