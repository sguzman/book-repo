The book is aimed at experienced Java developers and system architects who want to develop complex Java applications using the OSWorkflow workflow engine. OSWorkflow is a flexible low-level workflow implementation for developers and architects; it is not a quick “plug-and-play” solution for non-technical end users.","details":{"authors":"Diego Adrian Naya Lazo","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1847191525","isbn-13":"978-1847191526","pages":"212 pages","publication date":"August 30, 2007","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"6.83Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/a1/a1882197dc32b1276276da1c7bf77f4f.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/co3","title":"OSWorkflow: A guide for Java developers and architects to integrating open-source Business Process Management: Get your workflow up and running with … OSWorkflow project with real-world examples"}
