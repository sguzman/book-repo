{"categories":["Engineering","Linux","Networking","Operating Systems","Sysadmin"],"desc":" The second edition of GUIDE TO PARALLEL OPERATING SYSTEMS WITH WINDOWS 7 AND LINUX continues its unique approach of examining two of the most prominent operating systems in parallel. Rather than using a compare and contrast model, each concept is first presented conceptually before demonstrating it simultaneously on both operating systems. Readers are able to instantly switch between Windows 7 and Linux Fedora 13 to complete the myriad of hands-on activities that reinforce the similarities between the two operating systems for each conceptual task. The virtualization approach used in the text provides complete flexibility and enables learners to use Microsoft Virtual PC 2007, Sun VirtualBox, or VMWare Workstation. This comprehensive guide will help readers develop the competencies they need in Windows 7 and Linux to maximize success in todayâ€™s classroom as well as in the business environment.","details":{"authors":"Shen Jiang, Terrill Freese","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1111543704","isbn-13":"978-1111543709","pages":"640 pages","publication date":"June 13, 2011","publisher":"Cengage Learning","size":"20.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/60/602cfc7921e181a98a7d4caa3193a61f.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bn7","title":"Guide to Parallel Operating Systems with Windows 7 and Linux (Networking)"}
