{"categories":["Engineering","Programming"],"desc":" Innovations in hardware architecture, like hyper-threading or multicore processors, mean that parallel computing resources are available for inexpensive desktop computers. In only a few years, many standard software products will be based on concepts of parallel programming implemented on such hardware, and the range of applications will be much broader than that of scientific computing, up to now the main application area for parallel computing.  Rauber and Rünger take up these recent developments in processor architecture by giving detailed descriptions of parallel programming techniques that are necessary for developing efficient programs for multicore processors as well as for parallel cluster systems and supercomputers. Their book is structured in three main parts, covering all areas of parallel computing: the architecture of parallel systems, parallel programming models and environments, and the implementation of efficient application algorithms. The emphasis lies on parallel programming techniques needed for different architectures.  The main goal of the book is to present parallel programming techniques that can be used in many situations for many application areas and which enable the reader to develop correct and efficient parallel programs. Many examples and exercises are provided to show how to apply the techniques. The book can be used as both a textbook for students and a reference book for professionals. The presented material has been used for courses in parallel programming at different universities for many years.","details":{"authors":"Gudula Rünger","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"364204817X","isbn-13":"978-3642048173","pages":"466 pages","publication date":"March 10, 2010","publisher":"Springer","size":"8.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/13/13902d00e9216df705275e19452dbb53.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9er","title":"Parallel Programming: for Multicore and Cluster Systems"}
