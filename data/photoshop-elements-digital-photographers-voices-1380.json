{"categories":["Digital Design/Media","Software"],"desc":" This book breaks new ground by doing something for digital photographers that’s never been done before—it cuts through the bull and shows you exactly “how to do it.” It’s not a bunch of theory; it doesn’t challenge you to come up with your own settings or figure things out on your own. Instead, it does something that virtually no other Elements book has ever done—it tells you flat-out which settings to use, when to use them, and why. If you’re looking for one of those “tell-me-everything-about-the-Unsharp-Mask-filter” books, this isn’t it. You can grab any other Elements book on the shelf, because they all do that. Instead, this book gives you the inside tips and tricks of the trade for organizing, correcting, editing, sharpening, retouching, and printing your photos like a pro. You’ll be absolutely amazed at how easy and effective these techniques are—once you know the secrets.","details":{"authors":"Matt Kloskowski, Scott Kelby","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"032180824X","isbn-13":"978-0321808240","pages":"456 pages","publication date":"December 31, 2011","publisher":"New Riders","size":"62.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/6e/6ec1a37152263ce8150d46ac496a159c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/frl","title":"The Photoshop Elements 10 Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter)"}
