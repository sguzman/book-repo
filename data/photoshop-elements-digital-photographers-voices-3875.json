{"categories":["Digital Design/Media","Software"],"desc":" This book breaks new ground by doing something for digital photographers that’s never been done before—it cuts through the bull and shows you exactly “how to do it.” It’s not a bunch of theory; it doesn’t challenge you to come up with your own settings or figure things out on your own. Instead, it does something that virtually no other Elements book has ever done—it tells you flat-out which settings to use, when to use them, and why.","details":{"authors":"Scott Kelby, Matt Kloskowski","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0321741331","isbn-13":"978-0321741332","pages":"456 pages","publication date":"December 17, 2010","publisher":"Peachpit Press","size":"127.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/be/be9fe2b6b9e24447f94bc4fe9f9cfa5b.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/a8j","title":"The Photoshop Elements 9 Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter)"}
