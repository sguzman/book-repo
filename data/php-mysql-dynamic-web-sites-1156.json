{"categories":["Databases","Programming","Scripting","Web Development"],"desc":" It hasn’t taken Web developers long to discover that when it comes to creating dynamic, database-driven Web sites, MySQL and PHP provide a winning open source combination. Add this book to the mix, and there’s no limit to the powerful, interactive Web sites that developers can create. With step-by-step instructions, complete scripts, and expert tips to guide readers, veteran author and database designer Larry Ullman gets right down to business: After grounding readers with separate discussions of first the scripting language (PHP) and then the database program (MySQL), he goes on to cover security, sessions and cookies, and using additional Web tools, with several sections devoted to creating sample applications. This guide is indispensable for intermediate- to advanced level Web designers who want to replace their static sites with something dynamic. In this edition, the bulk of the new material covers the latest versions of both technologies: PHP 6 (due out in 2008) and MySQL 5 (available now). The book’s publication date is likely to beat the official release of PHP 6, making it one of the first books available on the subject.","details":{"authors":"Larry Ullman","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"032152599X","isbn-13":"978-0321525994","pages":"648 pages","publication date":"December 29, 2007","publisher":"Peachpit Press","size":"13.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b8/b8bf15dcc9766a0b9538165a3626b9af.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/enf","title":"PHP 6 and MySQL 5 for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide"}
