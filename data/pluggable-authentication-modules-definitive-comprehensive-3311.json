It shows in detail how PAM works and how it is configured. Then 11 common modules used across UNIX/Linux distributions are examined and explained, including all their parameters. Installation of third-party modules is discussed, and the development of new modules and PAM-aware applications is outlined. This book is for experienced system administrators and developers working with multiple Linux/UNIX servers or with both UNIX and Windows servers.
