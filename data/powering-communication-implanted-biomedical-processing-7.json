{"categories":["Data Management","Engineering","Hardware","Signal Processing"],"desc":" This book describes new circuits and systems for implantable biomedical applications and explains the design of a batteryless, remotely-powered implantable micro-system, designed for long-term patient monitoring. Following new trends in implantable biomedical applications, the authors demonstrate a system which is capable of efficient, remote powering and reliable data communication. Novel architecture and design methodologies are used to transfer power with a low-power, optimized inductive link and data is transmitted by a reliable communication link. Additionally, an electro-mechanical solution is presented for tracking and monitoring the implantable system, while the patient is mobile.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"epub","isbn-10":"3319211781","isbn-13":"978-3319211787","pages":"146 pages","publication date":"September 18, 2015","publisher":"Springer","size":"5.85Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b2/b24aaafdb5388b9ea062b54f8b3d9ec1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h5g","title":"Remote Powering and Data Communication for Implanted Biomedical Systems (Analog Circuits and Signal Processing)"}
