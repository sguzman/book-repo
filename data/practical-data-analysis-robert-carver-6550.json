{"categories":["Data Management","Engineering"],"desc":" Being an effective analyst or a well-informed consumer of analyses requires that you know how to properly define the problem, apply suitable statistical techniques, and clearly and honestly communicate the results. Being a well-informed consumer of analyses requires the same skills so that you can recognize them in action. Robert Carverâ€™s Practical Data Analysis with JMP uses the powerful interactive and visual approach of JMP to introduce readers to the logic and methods of statistical thinking and data analysis. The book can stand on its own as a learning resource or be used to supplement a standard introduction-to-statistics textbook. It includes a myriad of examples and problems that rely on real sets of data, often starting with an important or interesting research question that an investigator has pursued. Reflective of the broad applicability of statistical reasoning, the problems come from a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, medicine, business, demography, among others, and include a number of international and historical examples.
