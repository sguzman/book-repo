{"categories":["Data Management","Databases","Programming"],"desc":" Unlike most other database programming books, which discuss and present database programming techniques through huge blocks of programming code, this book uses a unique writing style to show readers how to develop professional and practical database programs using Visual Basic.NET 2005 Design Tools and Wizards related to ADO.NET 2.0, and to apply codes that are auto-generated by using Wizards. Avoiding overly large blocks of code, the book shows a simple and easy way to create database programs and enable the reader to build professional and practical databases more efficiently. In addition to Design Tools and Wizards, the runtime object method is also discussed and analyzed to allow users to design and implement more sophisticated data-driven applications with complicated coding techniques. Three popular database systems – Microsoft Access, SQL Server 2005, and Oracle Database 10g Express Edition (XE) – are discussed in detail, with practical examples and sample projects. This book will attract college students, programmers, and software engineers alike.  Sample code and additional exercise questions for students, as well as solutions and lecture slides for instructors are available via the web (www.cambridge.org/9780521712354).","details":{"authors":"Ying Bai","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521712351","isbn-13":"978-0521712354","pages":"792 pages","publication date":"October 20, 2008","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"45.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/51/5123003da76aa6c0148246edbbb8ccfa.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8jl","title":"Practical Database Programming with Visual Basic.NET"}
