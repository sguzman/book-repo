{"categories":["Designing","Engineering"],"desc":" Using the fluid physics of flow and pressure to operate a moving mechanism, hydraulic systems have been ubiquitous in modern industry and transportation for many, many years. This book, originally written as an excellent introduction to the design and use of hydraulic systemsâ€“their components and their full systems, will with this new edition l be thoroughly updated and expanded to reflect new advances in digital control and in the integration of hydraulics into new applications such as wind turbines. Improved figures and diagrams will help to ensure a loyal and growing readership among professionals and students alike.","details":{"authors":"Peter Chapple","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1606504525","isbn-13":"978-1606504529","pages":"200 pages","publication date":"December 31, 2014","publisher":"Momentum Press","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/c6/c614bb57d34a445fc4e7436bea4f6f4f.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/d18","title":"Principles of Hydraulic Systems Design, Second Edition"}
