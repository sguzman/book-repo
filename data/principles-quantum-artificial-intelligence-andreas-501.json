{"categories":["Machine Learning"],"desc":" In this book, we introduce quantum computation and its application to AI. We highlight problem solving and knowledge representation framework. Based on information theory, we cover two main principles of quantum computation â€” Quantum Fourier transform and Grover search. Then, we indicate how these two principles can be applied to problem solving and finally present a general model of a quantum computer that is based on production systems.","details":{"authors":"Andreas Wichert","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9814566748","isbn-13":"978-9814566742","pages":"276 pages","publication date":"December 23, 2013","publisher":"World Scientific Publishing Company","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/47/47a12ea4d42c74d5b159919ac6db157a.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/a3g","title":"Principles of Quantum Artificial Intelligence"}
