{"categories":["Manual"],"desc":" AirPrint is a feature in Apple Inc.’s operating systems starting with OS X Lion and iOS 4.2.1,[ for printing via a wireless LAN, either directly to AirPrint-compatible printers or to non-compatible printers by way of a AirPrint Activator. This e-book will help you understand how to Print from your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch to ANY your existing printer without an AirPrint Printer or another app. O’Print is a Windows utility that allows the Windows PC to be AirPrint-Compatible (also as an AirPrint Activator for Windows). You do not need to install apps or buy a new AirPrint printer. ANY existing printer can be connected to Airprint from an iPad, iPhone, or iPhone touch in addition to basic printing from Safari, Mail or Photo. O’Print lets you print to PDF and to your dropbox. There is no client limit and no shared printer limit. All iDevices and all printers can be utilized in O’Print.  Because the printing is accomplished by the native iDevice print engine, you can also print from any other app.","details":{"authors":"Ron Chen","format":"azw3","isbn-10":null,"isbn-13":null,"pages":"14 pages","publication date":null,"publisher":null,"size":"0.53Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/29/29e89e47ce8daa28cd9c85f73584507b.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/cz0","title":"How to Print from iPad or iPhone to Any Printer without apps: Turns all printers to be airprint pritners"}
