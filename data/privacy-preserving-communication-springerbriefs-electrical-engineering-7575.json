{"categories":["Data Management","Engineering","Internet of Things","Web Development"],"desc":"This book mainly concentrates on protecting data security and privacy when participants communicate with each other in the Internet of Things (IoT). Technically, this book categorizes and introduces a collection of secure and privacy-preserving data communication schemes/protocols in three traditional scenarios of IoT: wireless sensor networks, smart grid and vehicular ad-hoc networks recently. This book presents three advantages which will appeal to readers. Firstly, it broadens readerâ€™s horizon in IoT by touching on three interesting and complementary topics: data aggregation, privacy protection, and key agreement and management. Secondly, various cryptographic schemes/protocols used to protect data confidentiality and integrity is presented. Finally, this book will illustrate how to design practical systems to implement the algorithms in the context of IoT communication. In summary, readers can simply learn and directly apply the new technologies to communicate data in IoT after reading this book.","details":{"authors":"Liehuang Zhu, Zijian Zhang, Chang Xu","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9811032343","isbn-13":"978-9811032349","pages":"78 pages","publication date":"February 27, 2017","publisher":"Springer","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/71/71da6294146b4e950144bfc9a3c0983f.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/arn","title":"Secure and Privacy-Preserving Data Communication in Internet of Things (SpringerBriefs in Electrical and Computer Engineering)"}
