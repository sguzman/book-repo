{"categories":["Engineering"],"desc":" PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS FOR ENGINEERS provides a one-semester, calculus-based introduction to engineering statistics that focuses on making intelligent sense of real engineering data and interpreting results. Traditional topics are presented thorough an accessible modern framework that emphasizes the statistical thinking, data collection and analysis, decision-making, and process improvement skills that engineers need on a daily basis to solve real problems. The text continues to be driven by its hallmark array of engineering applications–thoroughly expanded and modernized for the 5th edition–which tackle timely, interesting, and illuminating scenarios that show students the rich context behind the concepts. Within the presentation of topics and applications the authors continually develop students’ intuition for collecting their own real data, analyzing it with the latest graphical tools, and interpreting the results with a goal of improving quality control and problem-solving process. Students will not only gain solid understanding of concepts and their real-life practicality, but will learn to become active statistical practitioners for their own future careers.","details":{"authors":"Madhuri Mulekar","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0534403026","isbn-13":"978-0534403027","pages":"848 pages","publication date":"June 22, 2010","publisher":"Cengage Learning","size":"13.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/30/30d44ed58bf812bc2a436970f619caff.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9zj","title":"Probability and Statistics for Engineers"}
