{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" Formal systems that describe computations over syntactic structures occur frequently in computer science. Logic programming provides a natural framework for encoding and animating such systems. However, these systems often embody variable binding, a notion that must be treated carefully at a computational level. This book aims to show that a programming language based on a simply typed version of higher-order logic provides an elegant, declarative means for providing such a treatment. Three broad topics are covered in pursuit of this goal. First, a proof-theoretic framework that supports a general view of logic programming is identified. Second, an actual language called λProlog is developed by applying this view to higher-order logic. Finally, a methodology for programming with specifications is exposed by showing how several computations over formal objects such as logical formulas, functional programs, and λ-terms and π-calculus expressions can be encoded in λProlog.","details":{"authors":"Gopalan Nadathur","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"052187940X","isbn-13":"978-0521879408","pages":"320 pages","publication date":"June 11, 2012","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/11/11d8703608f96dcf9e6102f2e5551aa3.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/aa5","title":"Programming with Higher-Order Logic"}
