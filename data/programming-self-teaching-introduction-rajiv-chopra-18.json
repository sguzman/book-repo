{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" Unlike many C programming books written by C programmers, this brief, self-teaching introduction was written by an instructor familiar with the needs of students. The book defines key programming terms as it teaches the basics of C programming. It contains numerous real world programming examples showing first the algorithm, immediately followed by the program for the algorithm, and then its output. End of chapter exercises with “hints” help to review and master the material under discussion. An appendix with fifteen “C Lab projects” with their solutions is also included.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1683920902","isbn-13":"978-1683920908","pages":"352 pages","publication date":"April 27, 2017","publisher":"Mercury Learning & Information","size":"3.97Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/e9/e933e89b89871866d82655c454a6c165.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/hcs","title":"C Programming: A Self-Teaching Introduction"}
