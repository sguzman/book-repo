{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" Visual, interactive, and engaging projects are the hallmark of this innovative book that marks a rapid departure from traditional computer science texts. Programming in Visual C++: Concepts and Projects uses a graphical user interface (GUI) approach instead of the traditional console (plan text) mode, to provide a thorough introduction to computer science and C++ concepts that is highly visual and enjoyable for the reader. Because Visual C++ no longer requires advanced skills to produce GUIs, even beginning readers are able to produce attractive and functional GUIs within the first few chapters. Coverage includes a comprehensive introduction to programming basics, including control and data structures, as well as object-oriented programming. Straightforward and easy to understand, this is a valuable resource for anyone interested in a computer science book that is as fun as it is informative.","details":{"authors":"James Allert","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"142390186X","isbn-13":"978-1423901860","pages":"776 pages","publication date":"February 20, 2008","publisher":"Cengage Learning","size":"34.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/19/1965b1a099d6638c1bd2d9319c60d214.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/cx4","title":"Programming with Visual C++: Concepts and Projects (Introduction to Programming)"}
