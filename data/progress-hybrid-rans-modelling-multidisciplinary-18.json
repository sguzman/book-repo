{"categories":["Designing"],"desc":" This book reports on the latest developments in computational fluid dynamics and turbulence modeling, with a special emphasis on hybrid RANS-LES methods and their industrial applications. It gathers the proceedings of the Sixth Symposium on Hybrid RANS-LES Methods, held on September 26-28 in Strasbourg, France. The different chapters covers a wealth of topics such as flow control, aero-acoustics, aero-elasticity and CFD-based multidisciplinary optimization. Further topics include wall-modelled Large Eddy Simulation (WMLES), embedded LES,  Lattice-Bolzman methods, turbulence-resolving applications and comparisons between LES, hybrid RANS-LES and URANS methods. The book addresses academic researchers, graduate students, industrial engineers, as well as industrial R&D managers and consultants dealing with turbulence modelling, simulation and measurement, and with multidisciplinary applications of computational fluid dynamics.","details":{"authors":"Yannick Hoarau, Shia-Hui Peng, Dieter Schwamborn, Alistair Revell","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319700308","isbn-13":"978-3319700304","pages":"524 pages","publication date":"May 7, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"30.49Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/3c/3c761532c51ad485ab977bd6f8aa61c2.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dz5","title":"Progress in Hybrid RANS-LES Modelling: Papers Contributed to the 6th Symposium on Hybrid RANS-LES Methods, 26-28 September 2016, Strasbourg, France … Fluid Mechanics and Multidisciplinary Design)"}
