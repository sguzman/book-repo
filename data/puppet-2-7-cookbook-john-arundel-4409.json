{"categories":["Manual","Networking","Sysadmin"],"desc":" This book is written in a Cookbook style showing you how to set up and expand your Puppet infrastructure. It progresses through detailed information on the language and features, external tools, reporting, monitoring, and troubleshooting, and concludes with many specific recipes for managing popular applications. The book assumes that the reader already has a working Puppet installation and perhaps has written some basic manifests or adapted some published modules. It also requires some experience of Linux systems administration, including familiarity with the command line, file system, and text editing. No programming experience is required.","details":{"authors":"John Arundel","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9781849515","isbn-13":"978-1849515382","pages":"300 pages","publication date":"October 24, 2011","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/8e/8e86107bf72db09b4a7f585b1c58883a.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bnh","title":"Puppet 2.7 Cookbook"}
