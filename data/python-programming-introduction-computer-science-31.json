{"categories":["Computer Science","Engineering","Programming"],"desc":" This third edition of John Zelle’s Python Programming continues the tradition of updating the text to reflect new technologies while maintaining a time-tested approach to teaching introductory computer science. An important change to this edition is the removal of most uses of eval and the addition of a discussion of its dangers. In our increasingly connected world, it’s never too early to begin considering computer security issues. This edition also uses several new graphics examples, developed throughout chapters 4-12.","details":{"authors":"John Zelle","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1590282752","isbn-13":"978-1590282755","pages":"552 pages","publication date":"August 8, 2016","publisher":"Franklin, Beedle & Associates","size":"6.12Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/78/78c63c95375e4047162d77bd52cc4270.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/de7","title":"Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, 3rd Ed."}
