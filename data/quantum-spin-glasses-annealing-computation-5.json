{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Quantum annealing is a new-generation tool of information technology, which helps in solving combinatorial optimization problems with high precision, based on the concepts of quantum statistical physics. Detailed discussion on quantum spin glasses and its application in solving combinatorial optimization problems is required for better understanding of quantum annealing concepts. Fulfilling this requirement, the book highlights recent development in quantum spin glasses including Nishimori line, replica method and quantum annealing methods along with the essential principles. Separate chapters on simulated annealing, quantum dynamics and classical spin models are provided for enhanced learning. Important topics including adiabatic quantum computers and quenching dynamics are discussed in detail. This text will be useful for students of quantum computation, quantum information, statistical physics and computer science.","details":{"authors":"Ryo Tamura, Bikas K.
