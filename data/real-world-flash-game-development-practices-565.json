{"categories":["Game Development","Programming","Software"],"desc":" This book covers Flash for the everyday developer. The average Flash developer doesnâ€™t have luxurious timelines, employers who understand the value of reusability, or the help of an information architect to design a usable experience. This book helps bridge the gap for these coders who may be used to C++, Java, or C# and want to move over to Flash. Griffith covers real-world scenarios pulled from his own experiences developing games for over 8 years in the industry.
