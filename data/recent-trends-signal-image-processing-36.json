{"categories":["Computing","Engineering","Image Processing"],"desc":" This book contains interesting findings of some state-of-the-art research in the field of signal and image processing. It contains twenty one chapters covering a wide range of signal processing applications involving filtering, encoding, classification, segmentation, clustering, feature extraction, denoising, watermarking, object recognition, reconstruction and fractal analysis. Various types of signals including image, video, speech, non-speech audio, handwritten text, geometric diagram, ECG and EMG signals, MRI, PET and CT scan images, THz signals, solar wind speed signals (SWS) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals have been dealt with. It demonstrates how new paradigms of intelligent computing like quantum computing can be applied to process and analyze signals in a most precise and effective manner. Processing of high precision signals for real time target recognition by radar and processing of brain images, ECG and EMG signals that feature in this book have significant implications in defense mechanism and medical diagnosis. There are also applications of hybrid methods, algorithms and image filters which are proving to be better than the individual techniques or algorithms. Thus the present volume, enriched in depth and variety of techniques and algorithms concerning processing of various types of signals, is likely to be used as a compact yet handy reference for the young researchers, academicians and scientists working in the domain of signal and image processing and also to the post graduate students of computer science and information technology.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9811088624","isbn-13":"978-9811088629","pages":"218 pages","publication date":"June 9, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"7.70Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/d5/d597a87a250969a79d12aa43fede9112.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/hal","title":"Recent Trends in Signal and Image Processing: ISSIP 2017 (Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing)"}
