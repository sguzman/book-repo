The 30 papers deal with the introduction of computer in schools in many countries around the world: Norway, South Africa, UK, Canada, Australia, USA, Finland, Chile, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Ireland, Israel and Poland. The authors are not professional historians but rather people who as teachers, students or researchers were involved in this history and they narrate their experiences from a personal perspective offering fascinating stories.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3642551181","isbn-13":"978-3642551185","pages":"423 pages","publication date":"May 7, 2014","publisher":"Springer","size":"9.13Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/0a/0a79d7f3265b4210575af01754179bac.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/hej","title":"Reflections on the History of Computers in Education: Early Use of Computers and Teaching about Computing in Schools"}
