{"categories":["Engineering","Hardware"],"desc":" Compared to binary switching functions, the multiple-valued functions (MV) offer more compact representations of the information content of signals modeled by logic functions and, therefore, their use fits very well in the general settings of data compression attempts and approaches. The first task in dealing with such signals is to provide mathematical methods for their representation in a way that will make their application in practice feasible. Representation of Multiple-Valued Logic Functions is aimed at providing an accessible introduction to these mathematical techniques that are necessary for application of related implementation methods and tools.
