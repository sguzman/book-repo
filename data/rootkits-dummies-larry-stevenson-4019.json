{"categories":["Manual"],"desc":" A rootkit is a type of malicious software that gives the hacker “root” or administrator access to your network. They are activated before your system’s operating system has completely booted up, making them extremely difficult to detect. Rootkits allow hackers to install hidden files, processes, and hidden user accounts. Hackers can use them to open back doors in order to intercept data from terminals, connections, and keyboards. A rootkit hacker can gain access to your systems and stay there for years, completely undetected.
