{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" C++ is a language that sets itself a bit apart from the rest. C++ has no garbage collection. You need to collect your own garbage. C++ has stack memory and heap memory. You need to control where you want to put your objects. It has constructors and destructors. You need to know when and how they are called. Then it has multiple inheritance, something thatâ€™s not part of most languages. It has pointers and references. You need to know how and when you should use them. Then you have virtual functions and virtual tables and virtual pointers. When you know these core concepts C++ becomes a powerful language to use because you can control your program to do exactly what you want. Then you can unleash the power of C++.","details":{"authors":"M Liyanage","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1511797541","isbn-13":"978-1511797542","pages":"296 pages","publication date":"October 29, 2015","publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/d3/d33cb3d8a0a9aed15343cf472175969e.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bhs","title":"Selected Topics in C++"}
