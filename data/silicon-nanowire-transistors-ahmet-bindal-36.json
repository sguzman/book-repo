{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This book describes the n and p-channel Silicon Nanowire Transistor (SNT) designs with single and dual-work functions, emphasizing low static and dynamic power consumption.  The authors describe a process flow for fabrication and generate SPICE models for building various digital and analog circuits.  These include an SRAM, a baseband spread spectrum transmitter, a neuron cell and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform in the digital domain, as well as high bandwidth single-stage and operational amplifiers, RF communication circuits in the analog domain, in order to show this technology’s true potential for the next generation VLSI.  ","details":{"authors":null,"format":"epub","isbn-10":"331927175X","isbn-13":"978-3319271750","pages":"165 pages","publication date":"February 24, 2016","publisher":"Springer","size":"5.06Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/3f/3fb0a060a8203947044bb38ae6769c85.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h5w","title":"Silicon Nanowire Transistors"}
