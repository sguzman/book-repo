{"categories":["Engineering","Hardware"],"desc":" This book describes new, fuzzy logic-based mathematical apparatus, which enable readers to work with continuous variables, while implementing whole circuit simulations with speed, similar to gate-level simulators and accuracy, similar to circuit-level simulators.  The author demonstrates newly developed principles of digital integrated circuit simulation and optimization that take into consideration various external and internal destabilizing factors, influencing the operation of digital ICs.  The discussion includes factors including radiation, ambient temperature, electromagnetic fields, and climatic conditions, as well as non-ideality of interconnects and power rails.","details":{"authors":"Vazgen Melikyan","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319716360","isbn-13":"978-3319716367","pages":"349 pages","publication date":"April 28, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"19.08Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b3/b3f3c70f5c822674488ca932596feb32.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/h1f","title":"Simulation and Optimization of Digital Circuits: Considering and Mitigating Destabilizing Factors"}
