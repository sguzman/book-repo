{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This book presents a framework for converting multitudes of data streams available today including weather patterns, stock prices, social media, traffic information, and disease incidents into actionable insights based on situation recognition. It computationally defines the notion of situations as an abstraction of millions of data points into actionable insights, describes a computational framework to model and evaluate such situations and presents an open-source web-based system called EventShop to implement them without necessitating programming expertise.","details":{"authors":null,"format":"epub","isbn-10":"3319305352","isbn-13":"978-3319305356","pages":"140 pages","publication date":"June 1, 2016","publisher":"Springer","size":"3.57Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/04/04799aaa57c50831e747a9a18b65ca5a.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/e9e","title":"Situation Recognition Using EventShop"}
