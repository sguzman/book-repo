{"categories":["Algorithms","Mobile Development","Networking"],"desc":" This book offers a broad overview of mobile communications and its databases, focusing on the processes and methods used in mobile communication networks. Drawing upon the insights of leading researchers, the bookâ€™s main focus is on the sliding window algorithm. In addition, the book discusses queuing theory concepts for measuring the realistic throughput and performance of mobile switching centers in global system for mobile communications (GSM) networks by applying the sliding window algorithm. Practical case studies, a full set of easy-to-access supplements, and extensive web resources make reading, learning about and teaching mobile communications easier than ever.","details":{"authors":"Nuka Mallikharjuna Rao, Mannava Muniratnam Naidu","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"9811084726","isbn-13":"978-9811084720","pages":"96 pages","publication date":"April 16, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"3.70Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/d7/d7a771d87e35251be0285f9ec229fca7.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dyo","title":"Sliding Window Algorithm for Mobile Communication Networks"}
