{"categories":["Engineering","Machine Learning","Programming"],"desc":" This text presents an overview of smart information systems for both the private and public sector, highlighting the research questions that can be studied by applying computational intelligence. The book demonstrates how to transform raw data into effective smart information services, covering the challenges and potential of this approach. Each chapter describes the algorithms, tools, measures and evaluations used to answer important questions. This is then further illustrated by a diverse selection of case studies reflecting genuine problems faced by SMEs, multinational manufacturers, service companies, and the public sector. Features: provides a state-of-the-art introduction to the field, integrating contributions from both academia and industry; reviews novel information aggregation services; discusses personalization and recommendation systems; examines sensor-based knowledge acquisition services, describing how the analysis of sensor data can be used to provide a clear picture of our world.","details":{"authors":"Frank Hopfgartner","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319141775","isbn-13":"978-3319141770","pages":"372 pages","publication date":"January 14, 2015","publisher":"Springer","size":"15.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/f8/f813d82b7414dd2e217a0f5fe9e8523b.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/7u7","title":"Smart Information Systems: Computational Intelligence for Real-Life Applications (Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)"}
