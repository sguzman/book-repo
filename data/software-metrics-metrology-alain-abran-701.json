{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Most of the software measures currently proposed to the industry bring few real benefits to either software managers or developers. This book looks at the classical metrology concepts from science and engineering, using them as criteria to propose an approach to analyze the design of current software measures and then design new software measures (illustrated with the design of a software measure that has been adopted as an ISO measurement standard). The book includes several case studies analyzing strengths and weaknesses of some of the software measures most often quoted. It is meant for software quality specialists and process improvement analysts and managers.","details":{"authors":"Alain Abran","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0470597208","isbn-13":"978-0470597200","pages":"348 pages","publication date":"June 28, 2010","publisher":"Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Pr","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/3d/3d6676d3c2edc671ef63f7c3029f368c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dpi","title":"Software Metrics and Software Metrology"}
