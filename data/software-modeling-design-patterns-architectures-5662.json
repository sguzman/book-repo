{"categories":["Designing"],"desc":" This book covers all you need to know to model and design software applications from use cases to software architectures in UML and shows how to apply the COMET UML-based modeling and design method to real-world problems. The author describes architectural patterns for various architectures, such as broker, discovery, and transaction patterns for service-oriented architectures, and addresses software quality attributes including maintainability, modifiability, testability, traceability, scalability, reusability, performance, availability, and security.    Complete case studies illustrate design issues for different software architectures: a banking system for client/server architecture, an online shopping system for service-oriented architecture, an emergency monitoring system for component-based software architecture, and an automated guided vehicle for real-time software architecture.    Organized as an introduction followed by several short, self-contained chapters, the book is perfect for senior undergraduate or graduate courses in software engineering and design, and for experienced software engineers wanting a quick reference at each stage of the analysis, design, and development of large-scale software systems.","details":{"authors":"Hassan Gomaa","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521764149","isbn-13":"978-0521764148","pages":"578 pages","publication date":"February 21, 2011","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"2.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/cb/cb1d6a929dd729af1bb057391e828695.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/7y4","title":"Software Modeling and Design: UML, Use Cases, Patterns, and Software Architectures"}
