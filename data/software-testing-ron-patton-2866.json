{"categories":["Testing"],"desc":" Software Testing is the book for new or aspiring software testers interested in learning about this crucial part of the software development process. The complexity and size of today’s software makes writing bug-free code extremely difficult, even for highly experienced programmers. Couple that with our increasing reliance on software for performing everyday tasks and its pervasiveness in the medical, telecommunications, manufacturing, and financial industries, and a software bug can spell disaster. Quality software can’t be created with an ad- hoc, part-time, bug hunt. It requires a methodical and disciplined approach to preventing, finding, and reporting bugs. Software Testing will show you what it takes to be a successful software tester, assuring that you discover those nasty bugs before your customers do.","details":{"authors":"Ron Patton","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0672319837","isbn-13":"978-0672319839","pages":"408 pages","publication date":"November 7, 2000","publisher":"Sams","size":"6.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/ae/aede5f4a7bd951f08d6b4711beb59e42.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/c9j","title":"Software Testing"}
