{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" In today’s market, secure software is a must for consumers. Many developers, however, are not familiar with the techniques needed to produce secure code or detect existing vulnerabilities. The Software Vulnerability Guide helps developers and testers better understand the underlying security flaws in software and provides an easy-to-use reference for security bugs. Most of these bugs (and the viruses, worms, and exploits that derive from them) start out as programmer mistakes. With this guide, professional programmers and testers will learn how to find, fix, and prevent these vulnerabilities before their software reaches the market. Detailed explanations and examples are provided for each of the vulnerabilities, as well as a summary sheet that can be referenced quickly. Tools that make it easier to recognize and prevent vulnerabilities are also explored, and source code snippets, commentary, and techniques are provided in easy-to-read sidebars. This guide is a must have for today’s software developers.","details":{"authors":"Scott G Chase","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1584503580","isbn-13":"978-1584503583","pages":"354 pages","publication date":"June 3, 2005","publisher":"Charles River Media","size":"7.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b5/b5914fe2da6c438c71ecd7796c8e7707.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/b1x","title":"The Software Vulnerability Guide (Programming Series) (Charles River Media Programming)"}
