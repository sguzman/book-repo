{"categories":["Programming"],"desc":" Poorly performing enterprise applications are the weakest links in a corporationâ€™s management chain, causing delays and disruptions of critical business functions. This groundbreaking book frames enterprise application performance engineering not as an art but as applied science built on model-based methodological foundation. The book introduces queuing models of enterprise application that visualize, demystify, explain, and solve system performance issues. Analysis of these models will help to discover and clarify unapparent connections and correlations among workloads, hardware architecture, and software parameters.","details":{"authors":"Leonid Grinshpan","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1118061578","isbn-13":"978-1118061572","pages":"232 pages","publication date":"February 28, 2012","publisher":"Wiley-IEEE Press","size":"4.88Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/8e/8eebad689fa173ae7e6875c8d822aeaf.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/dkj","title":"Solving Enterprise Applications Performance Puzzles: Queuing Models to the Rescue"}
