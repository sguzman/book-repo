{"categories":["Manual","Testing"],"desc":" Achieve higher levels of Software Quality with Sonar Take full advantage of the Sonar platform and its visual components to track code quality and defects Create step by step software quality profiles that match your needs. Real world examples that use Sonar efficiently to assess quality and improve Java code. In Detail Sonar is an open source platform used by development teams to manage source code quality. Sonar has been developed with this main objective in mind: make code quality management accessible to everyone with minimal effort. As such, Sonar provides code analyzers, reporting tools, manual reviews, defect-hunting modules, and Time Machine as core functionalities. It also comes with a plugin mechanism enabling the community to extend the functionality, making Sonar the one-stop-shop for source code quality by addressing not only the developers requirements, but also the manager’s needs. The “Sonar Code Quality Testing Essentials” book will help you understand the different factors that define code quality and how to improve your own or your team’s code using Sonar. You will learn to use Sonar effectively and explore the quality of your source code in the following axes: Coding Standards Documentation and Comments Potential Bugs and Defects. Unit Testing Coverage Design and Complexity Through practical examples, you will customize Sonar components and widgets to identify areas where your source code is lacking. The book goes down to proposing good practices and common solutions that you can put to use to improve such code. You will start with installing and setting up a Sonar server and performing your first project analysis. Then you will go through the process of creating a custom and balanced quality profile exploring all Sonar components through practical examples. After reading the book, you will be able to analyze any project using Sonar and know how to read and evaluate quality metrics.","details":{"authors":"Charalampos S.
