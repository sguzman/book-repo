{"categories":["Networking"],"desc":" This book provides a comprehensive description of an optical communications technology known as free space opticalâ€”a next-generation communications network that uses optical signals through the atmosphere instead of fiber, RF, or microwaves. This technology potentially offers more complex ultrabandwidth communication services simultaneously to multiple users and in a very short time, compared to fiber optic technology. This text presents established and new advancements drawn from the latest research and development in components, networking, operation, and practices.  ","details":{"authors":"Stamatios V.
