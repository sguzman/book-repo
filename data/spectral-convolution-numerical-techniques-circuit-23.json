{"categories":["Hardware"],"desc":" This book describes a set of tools and algorithms then enable the electrical engineer in fields such as circuit design, power delivery, signal integrity, analog design, package and board modeling to arrive at approximate and exact solutions robustly and relatively efficiently, even when typical software packages may fail to do so. By leveraging well established and time tested methods, the author demonstrates how the practitioner will be able to deal with various circuit design problems and signal integrity issues both in the frequency and time domains. The presented tool set is an alternative to “brute force” time discretization and software utilization, offering great insight into the operations of linear systems ranging from RLC networks to device modeling. ","details":{"authors":"Fuad Badrieh","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319714368","isbn-13":"978-3319714363","pages":"976 pages","publication date":"March 29, 2018","publisher":"Springer","size":"47.29Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/d6/d6175b1584cb09081a6db9fa15233692.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/eya","title":"Spectral, Convolution and Numerical Techniques in Circuit Theory"}
