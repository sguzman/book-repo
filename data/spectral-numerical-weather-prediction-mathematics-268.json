{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This book provides a comprehensive overview of numerical weather prediction (NWP) focusing on the application of the spectral method in NWP models. The author illustrates the use of the spectral method in theory as well as in its application to building a full prototypical spectral NWP model, from the formulation of continuous model equations through development of their discretized forms to coded statements of the model.
