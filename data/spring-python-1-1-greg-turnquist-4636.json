{"categories":["Programming","Web Development"],"desc":" The book is an introduction to Spring Python. It starts with simple practical applications, moving on to more advanced applications with two advanced case studies at the end of the book. It is packed with screenshots, examples, and ready-to-use code making it very suitable for a beginner while also showing tactics and concepts suitable for the most experienced developers. Each chapter starts with a simple problem to solve, and then dives into how Spring Python provides the solution with step-by-step code samples. Along the way, screenshots and diagrams are used to show critical parts of the solution. The case studies start off with a handful of use cases, and then proceed step-by-step to incrementally develop features. Some use cases are left to the reader to implement as an exercise. Key problems discovered along the way are exposed and then solved, giving the reader the chance to solve them, or to read the authorâ€™s solutions. This book is for Python developers who want to take their applications to the next level, by adding/using parts that scale their application up, without adding unnecessary complexity. It is also helpful for Java developers who want to mix in some Python to speed up their coding effort.","details":{"authors":"Greg Lee Turnquist","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849510660","isbn-13":"978-1849510660","pages":"264 pages","publication date":"May 21, 2010","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/97/97fddb3488317f3441b8d2be1793a58d.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/eza","title":"Spring Python 1.1"}
