{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Statistical downscaling and bias correction are becoming standard tools in climate impact studies. This book provides a comprehensive reference to widely-used approaches, and additionally covers the relevant user context and technical background, as well as a synthesis and guidelines for practitioners. It presents the main approaches including statistical downscaling, bias correction and weather generators, along with their underlying assumptions, skill and limitations. Relevant background information on user needs and observational and climate model uncertainties is complemented by concise introductions to the most important concepts in statistical and dynamical modelling. A substantial part is dedicated to the evaluation of regional climate projections and their value in different user contexts. Detailed guidelines for the application of downscaling and the use of downscaled information in practice complete the volume. Its modular approach makes the book accessible for developers and practitioners, graduate students and experienced researchers, as well as impact modellers and decision makers.","details":{"authors":"Douglas Maraun, Martin Widmann","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1107066050","isbn-13":"978-1107066052","pages":"360 pages","publication date":"February 23, 2018","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"15.58Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/1d/1df835c18ae00a8788776c547922ba31.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/clv","title":"Statistical Downscaling and Bias Correction for Climate Research"}
