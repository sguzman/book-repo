{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" This introductory text to statistical machine translation (SMT) provides all of the theories and methods needed to build a statistical machine translator, such as Google Language Tools and Babelfish. In general, statistical techniques allow automatic translation systems to be built quickly for any language-pair using only translated texts and generic software. With increasing globalization, statistical machine translation will be central to communication and commerce. Based on courses and tutorials, and classroom-tested globally, it is ideal for instruction or self-study, for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in computer science and/or computational linguistics, and researchers in natural language processing. The companion website provides open-source corpora and tool-kits.","details":{"authors":"Philipp Koehn","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0521874157","isbn-13":"978-0521874151","pages":"446 pages","publication date":"January 18, 2010","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/2f/2f4260fa9d5156d916c250bf19a7b5f1.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/epj","title":"Statistical Machine Translation"}
