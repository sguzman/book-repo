{"categories":["Data Management","Programming"],"desc":" This second edition of Data Structures Using C has been developed to provide a comprehensive and consistent coverage of both the abstract concepts of data structures as well as the implementation of these concepts using C language. It begins with a thorough overview of the concepts of C programming followed by introduction of different data structures and methods to analyse the complexity of different algorithms. It then connects these concepts and applies them to the study of various data structures such as arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs. The book utilizes a systematic approach wherein the design of each of the data structures is followed by algorithms of different operations that can be performed on them, and the analysis of these algorithms in terms of their running times. Each chapter includes a variety of end-chapter exercises in the form of MCQs with answers, review questions, and programming exercises to help readers test their knowledge.","details":{"authors":"Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science Reema Thareja","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0198099304","isbn-13":"978-0198099307","pages":"560 pages","publication date":"October 9, 2014","publisher":"Oxford University Press, USA","size":"18.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/88/8808950c31702a880180a1cb28943d8e.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/acv","title":"Data Structures Using C"}
