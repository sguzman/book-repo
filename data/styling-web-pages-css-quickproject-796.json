{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" Sometimes it’s hard to get started with a new technology. That’s where this book excels. It’s not going to show Web designers everything there is to know about CSS but rather will provide a solid introduction from which to build their CSS knowledge. The beginning of the book starts with the basics — rules, selectors, classes, IDs, the cascade, internal and external style sheets, Divs, boxes, floats, padding, margins — everything is covered. Next comes styling elements, working with images, menus and navigation, and moving styles from internal to external style sheets. Rounding out this project-based guide is working with browsers, both old and new, and debugging CSS. Succinct and to the point, it’s the perfect book for designers without a lot of time who need to understand and start using CSS.","details":{"authors":"Tom Negrino, Dori Smith","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0321555570","isbn-13":"978-0321555571","pages":"144 pages","publication date":"March 7, 2009","publisher":"Peachpit Press","size":"5.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/57/5736ec0c1644c2846c40333f71bc40f7.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8t0","title":"Styling Web Pages with CSS: Visual QuickProject Guide"}
