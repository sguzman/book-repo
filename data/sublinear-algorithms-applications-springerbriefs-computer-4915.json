The text offers an essential introduction to sublinear algorithms, explaining why they are vital to large scale data systems. It also demonstrates how to apply sublinear algorithms to three familiar big data applications: wireless sensor networks, big data processing in Map Reduce and smart grids. These applications present common experiences, bridging the theoretical advances of sublinear algorithms and the application domain. Sublinear Algorithms for Big Data Applications is suitable for researchers, engineers and graduate students in the computer science, communications and signal processing communities.","details":{"authors":"Dan Wang, Zhu Han","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"3319204475","isbn-13":"978-3319204475","pages":"85 pages","publication date":"July 25, 2015","publisher":"Springer","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/9c/9c489dd1470aec26577eb7f5a4890c70.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/aco","title":"Sublinear Algorithms for Big Data Applications (SpringerBriefs in Computer Science)"}
