{"categories":["Management","Programming"],"desc":"This book deals with stochastic combinatorial optimization problems in supply chain disruption management, with a particular focus on management of disrupted flows in customer-driven supply chains. The problems are modeled using a scenario based stochastic mixed integer programming to address risk-neutral, risk-averse and mean-risk decision-making in the presence of supply chain disruption risks. The book focuses on innovative, computationally efficient portfolio approaches to supply chain disruption management, e.g., selection of primary and recovery supply portfolios, demand portfolios, capacity portfolios, etc.","details":{"authors":"Tadeusz Sawik","format":"epub","isbn-10":"3319588222","isbn-13":"978-3319588223","pages":"349 pages","publication date":"July 1, 2017","publisher":"Springer","size":"6.48Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b4/b492fb9895383c653aa30f20e9948cbf.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/cb9","title":"Supply Chain Disruption Management Using Stochastic Mixed Integer Programming"}
