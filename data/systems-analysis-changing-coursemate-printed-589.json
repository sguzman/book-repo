{"categories":["Designing","Engineering","Software"],"desc":" SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN IN A CHANGING WORLD teaches the conceptual technical and managerial foundations for systems analysis design and implementation, as well as project management principles for systems development projects. The fifth edition continues the book’s popular format of teaching both approaches to systems analysis and design: the traditional (structured) and the object-oriented (OO). This new edition offers expanded coverage of the object-oriented approach to design in two newly formed chapters, with Chapter 11 concentrating on principles and Chapter 12 covering use case realizations in depth. New and enhanced coverage of project management also teaches important issues related to adaptive projects as well as the traditional predictive approach to projects. Added perspective is provided for students via the running case studies and “Best Practices” feature.","details":{"authors":"John W. Satzinger, Robert B. Jackson, Stephen D.
