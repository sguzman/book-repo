{"categories":["Manual"],"desc":" With the right applications, the iPad can become more than just a content consumption device for videos, music, and electronic books. It can be a content production device as well — generating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations for the workplace. This ability to produce content, given the right applications, immediately shifts the iPad into a useful business device. For example, businesses that depend on fast, accurate business processes can utilize the iPad to supply data quickly, invoice customers, and manage vendors from a reliable, highly mobile platform. TAKE YOUR IPAD TO WORK is for anyone who wants to get started using the iPad in a professional environment. By demonstrating the different types of business apps available for the iPad, this book will show you how using an iPad in many situations is actually more convenient and productive than using a laptop or a PC. You’ll also be able to make a stronger case for using the iPad effectively in your place of business.","details":{"authors":"Brian Proffitt","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1435458990","isbn-13":"978-1435458994","pages":"384 pages","publication date":"October 13, 2010","publisher":"Cengage Learning PTR","size":"33.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/00/00b0c73a8b3084ed4ac3d23151a879f6.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/fu5","title":"Take Your iPad to Work"}
