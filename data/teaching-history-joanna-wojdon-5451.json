{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Incorporating Information and Communication Technology tools into the teaching and learning of history has become a common practice worldwide. It is no longer a question of if, but of how to introduce it in the classroom in order to make history education more effective and enjoyable. This book gathers the experiences and reflections of researchers from three continents, based on their own activities and on empirical studies. The contributions concentrate on videogames related to the past, history e-textbooks, and applications for mobile devices with historical content. Some texts deal explicitly with global phenomena, such as the Assassins Creed or Colonization games, some present materials developed for the international market, such as a European e-textbook or mobile phone applications, while others concentrate on local experiences, such as a Chinese e-schoolbag, a Swiss tablet application, Polish and Estonian e-textbooks, or English teacher training. The book is a result, and a reinforcement, of the belief that history educators can benefit from the lessons learnt in other places of the globalising world.","details":{"authors":"Joanna Wojdon","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1443885843","isbn-13":"978-1443885843","pages":"220 pages","publication date":"February 1, 2016","publisher":"Cambridge Scholars Publishing","size":"1.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/59/59d0dae21ba7e407292cd5be893372fb.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/eyq","title":"E-teaching History"}
