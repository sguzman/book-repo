{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Presenting state-of-the-art research into the dynamic field of tunable micro-optics, this is the first book to provide a comprehensive survey covering a varied range of topics including novel materials, actuation concepts and new imaging systems in optics. Internationally renowned researchers present a diverse range of chapters on cutting-edge materials, devices and subsystems, including soft matter, artificial muscles, tunable lenses and apertures, photonic crystals, and complete tunable imagers. Special contributions also provide in-depth treatment of micro-optical characterisation, scanners, and the use of natural eye models as inspiration for new concepts in advanced optics. With applications extending from medical diagnosis to fibre telecommunications, Tunable Micro-optics equips readers with a solid understanding of the broader technical context through its interdisciplinary approach to the realisation of new types of optical systems. This is an essential resource for engineers in industry and academia, and advanced students working on optical systems design.","details":{"authors":"Claudia Dupp√©","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1107032458","isbn-13":"978-1107032453","pages":"473 pages","publication date":"March 10, 2016","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"18.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/4f/4f9936b82d05697e354e313ab0158f37.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/e9p","title":"Tunable Micro-optics"}
