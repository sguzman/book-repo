This book covers the basics of creating a new system from scratch and explains what software is installed. Youâ€™ll take a tour of installing the Ubuntu Linux distribution system in most environments, including nontraditional situations such as dual-boot and text-based installations. Plus, clear explanations of each of the installed applications show you how to get the most out of each application, rather than simply using them as they exist.","details":{"authors":"Richard Blum","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0470395087","isbn-13":"978-0470395080","pages":"840 pages","publication date":"April 13, 2009","publisher":"Wiley","size":"29.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/8b/8b3225351138e29f7f29cfae4c48c742.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/8lt","title":"Ubuntu Linux Secrets"}
