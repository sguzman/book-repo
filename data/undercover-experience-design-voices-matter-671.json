And while anyone can learn the UX remedies usability testing, personas, prototyping and so on unless your organization ‘gets it’, putting them into practice is trickier. Undercover User Experience is a pragmatic guide from the front lines, giving frank advice on making UX work in real companies with real problems. Readers will learn how to fit research, ideation, prototyping and testing into their daily workflow, and how to design good user experiences under the all-too-common constraints of time, budget and culture.","details":{"authors":"James Box","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0321719905","isbn-13":"978-0321719904","pages":"192 pages","publication date":"September 27, 2010","publisher":"New Riders","size":"3.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/19/19988e3fa76e4e716dca19b396c74563.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ejo","title":"Undercover User Experience Design (Voices That Matter)"}
