{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Maple is a powerful symbolic computation system that is widely used in universities around the world. This short introduction gives readers an insight into the rules that control how the system works, and how to understand, fix, and avoid common problems. Topics covered include algebra, calculus, linear algebra, graphics, programming, and procedures. Each chapter contains numerous illustrative examples, using mathematics that does not extend beyond first-year undergraduate material. Maple worksheets containing these examples are available for download from the authorâ€™s personal website. The book is suitable for new users, but where advanced topics are central to understanding Maple they are tackled head-on. Many concepts which are absent from introductory books and manuals are described in detail. With this book, students, teachers and researchers will gain a solid understanding of Maple and how to use it to solve complex mathematical problems in a simple and efficient way.","details":{"authors":"Ian Thompson","format":"azw3","isbn-10":"1316628140","isbn-13":"978-1316628140","pages":"235 pages","publication date":"November 14, 2016","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","size":"1.40Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/cd/cdf4806d277195f35c6b7b4a7923b54d.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/c2w","title":"Understanding Maple"}
