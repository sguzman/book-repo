{"categories":["Hardware"],"desc":" The newcomer to Microchip’s PIC micro controllers invariably gets an LED to flash as their first attempt to master this technology. You can use just a simple LED indicator in order to show that your initial attempt is working, which will give you confidence to move forward. This is how the book begins – simple programs to flash LEDs, and eventually by stages to use other display indicators such as the 7-segment display, alphanumeric liquid crystal displays and eventually a color graphic LCD. As the reader progresses through the book, bigger and upgraded PIC chips are introduced, with full circuit diagrams and source code, both in assembler and C. In addition, a small tutorial is included using the MPLAB programming environment, together with the EAGLE schematic and PCB design package to enable readers to create their own designs using the book’s many case studies as working examples to work from.","details":{"authors":"Richard Grodzik","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0905705734","isbn-13":"978-0905705736","pages":"192 pages","publication date":"October 20, 2008","publisher":"Elektor Electronics Publishing","size":"4.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/f1/f11cf82d9fb006786c071bf18a21d444.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/c8c","title":"Universal Display Book for PIC Microcontrollers"}
