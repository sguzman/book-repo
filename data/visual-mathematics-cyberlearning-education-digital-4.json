{"categories":["Manual","Security"],"desc":" This first book in the series will describe the Net Generation as visual learners who thrive when surrounded with new technologies and whose needs can be met with the technological innovations. These new learners seek novel ways of studying, such as collaborating with peers, multitasking, as well as use of multimedia, the Internet, and other Information and Communication Technologies. Here we present mathematics as a contemporary subject that is engaging, exciting and enlightening in new ways. For example, in the distributed environment of cyber space, mathematics learners play games, watch presentations on YouTube, create Java applets of mathematics simulations and exchange thoughts over the Instant Messaging tool. How should mathematics education resonate with these learners and technological novelties that excite them?","details":{"authors":null,"format":"epub","isbn-10":"9400723202","isbn-13":"978-9400723207","pages":"250 pages","publication date":"December 23, 2012","publisher":"Springer","size":"2.36Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/9b/9b32d899d12278de96444f73a49d037d.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/fgc","title":"Visual Mathematics and Cyberlearning (Mathematics Education in the Digital Era)"}
