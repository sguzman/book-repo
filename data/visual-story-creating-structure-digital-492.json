Now in full color for the first time, this best-seller offers a clear view of the relationship between the story/script structure and the visual structure of a film, video, animated piece, or video game. You’ll learn how to structure your visuals as carefully as a writer structures a story or a composer structures music. Understanding visual structure allows you to communicate moods and emotions, and most importantly, reveals the critical relationship between story structure and visual structure.","details":{"authors":"Bruce Block","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0240807790","isbn-13":"978-0240807799","pages":"310 pages","publication date":"October 26, 2007","publisher":"Focal Press","size":"22.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/df/dfd713dc339d277be680bb64a4a0d92c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bpy","title":"The Visual Story: Creating the Visual Structure of Film, TV and Digital Media"}
