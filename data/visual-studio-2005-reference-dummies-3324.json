{"categories":["Manual","Programming","Software"],"desc":" A thorough revision to the Visual Studio 2005 All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies makes this the ideal book for new programmers or Java programmers looking to get up and running with Visual Studio. The book will be a comprehensive, value-priced reference for the entire Visual Studio 2005.  Microsoft’s catch-phrase for Visual Studio 2005 is personal productivity. The goal of personal productivity is to allow the developer to work at a higher level of abstraction. The goal of this book is to show the reader how to build applications using these productivity features of VS. As a result, language syntax and programming constructs are de-emphasized in favor of showing the user how to let VS generate the code.  ","details":{"authors":"Vanessa L.
