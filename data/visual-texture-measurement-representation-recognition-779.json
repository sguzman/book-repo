{"categories":["Machine Learning"],"desc":" This book surveys the state of the art in multidimensional, physically-correct visual texture modeling. Features: reviews the entire process of texture synthesis, including material appearance representation, measurement, analysis, compression, modeling, editing, visualization, and perceptual evaluation; explains the derivation of the most common representations of visual texture, discussing their properties, advantages, and limitations; describes a range of techniques for the measurement of visual texture, including BRDF, SVBRDF, BTF and BSSRDF; investigates the visualization of textural information, from texture mapping and mip-mapping to illumination- and view-dependent data interpolation; examines techniques for perceptual validation and analysis, covering both standard pixel-wise similarity measures and also methods of visual psychophysics; reviews the applications of visual textures, from visual scene analysis in medical applications, to high-quality visualizations in the automotive industry.","details":{"authors":"Jiri Filip","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1447149017","isbn-13":"978-1447149019","pages":"284 pages","publication date":"January 18, 2013","publisher":"Springer","size":"15.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/55/5526cc4e032597d4e6de05b683f742a6.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/byr","title":"Visual Texture: Accurate Material Appearance Measurement, Representation and Modeling (Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)"}
