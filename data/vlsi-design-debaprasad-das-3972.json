{"categories":["Designing"],"desc":" Beginning with an introduction to VLSI systems and basic concepts of MOS transistors, this second edition of the  book then proceeds to describe the various concepts of VLSI, such as the structure and operation of MOS transistors and inverters, standard cell library design and its characterization, analog and digital CMOS logic design, semiconductor memories, and BiCMOS technology and circuits. It then provides an exhaustive step-wise discussion of the various stages involved in designing a VLSI chip (which includes logic synthesis, timing analysis, floor planning, placement and routing, verification, and testing). In addition, the book includes chapters on FPGA architecture, VLSI process technology, subsystem design, and low power logic circuits.","details":{"authors":"Debaprasad Das","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"0198094868","isbn-13":"978-0198094869","pages":"660 pages","publication date":"February 18, 2016","publisher":"OUP India","size":"24.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/9b/9b3c198c839af5b990142250c74bf9c6.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ang","title":"VLSI Design"}
