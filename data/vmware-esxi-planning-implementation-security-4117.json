{"categories":["Operating Systems","Security"],"desc":" VMware ESXi is the easiest way to get started with virtualization — and it’s free. It allows administrators to consolidate their applications onto fewer servers and start saving money through reduced hardware, power, cooling, and administration costs. VMware ESXi has been optimized and tested to run even their most resource-intensive applications and databases with minimal performance overhead. “VMware ESXi: Planning, Implementation, and Security” covers the key features critical to successfully planning for and implementing VMware’s ESXi. The book is perfect for current VMware VI3 and vSphere administrators who may be planning their migration to vSphere ESXi. These users may have some experience with ESXi but not yet have it deployed within their production environment. This book provides the guidance to implement ESXi in their environment, ensuring a smooth transition from their current deployment of ESX.","details":{"authors":"Dave Mishchenko","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1435454952","isbn-13":"978-1435454958","pages":"480 pages","publication date":"November 8, 2010","publisher":"Cengage Learning PTR","size":"7.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/60/604d3a342219f1869758497b94f660e4.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/9wl","title":"VMware ESXi: Planning, Implementation, and Security"}
