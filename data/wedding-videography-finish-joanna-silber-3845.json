{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"desc":" Wedding production is unique in that every shot must be obtained in a single take, as in documentary filmmaking, but the client expects the finished product to look like a feature film, with perfect capture of every moment.  Getting good-looking footage, while fighting problems such as loud settings, uncontrollable light and rapid scene changes, make wedding videography very challenging compared to other types of filmmaking. “Wedding Videography: Start to Finish” is the first technical guide that explains how to balance the expectations of the bridal couple with the realities of single-take shooting. These discrepancies will be explained through lessons in gear selection, shot set-up, how to work in poorly lit conditions, and how to make the best of bad angles, audio and light.  The book further explains how to improve and stylize footage through editing and post production techniques. With “Wedding Videography: Start to Finish,” video amateurs and professionals new to wedding coverage alike will find a complete guide on every aspect of becoming a successful wedding videographer, from selecting production gear and software through the shooting and editing process, and even the business aspects of the wedding industry including client expectations, wedding etiquette, legal issues and product delivery.","details":{"authors":"Joanna Silber","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1435454480","isbn-13":"978-1435454484","pages":"448 pages","publication date":"March 18, 2010","publisher":"Cengage Learning PTR","size":"12.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/b0/b02b17317d29fbf475012af416bb7f46.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/ctq","title":"Wedding Videography Start to Finish"}
