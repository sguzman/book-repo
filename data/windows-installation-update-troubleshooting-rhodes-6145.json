When tasked with deploying Windows operating systems, there can seem to be an overwhelming amount of tools and techniques to learn to master this process. Whether you are installing a new Windows operating system locally, or looking to deploy a customized build to 1000s of devices in your network, you will need to understand how to do this successfully and reliably. This book steps up through local installations and upgrades through to Lite Touch deployments using WDS and MDT, and then to Zero Touch installations using Microsoft System Center. Management of updates to Windows is also covered, using both on-premises technologies and cloud-based services. In this book youâ€™ll learn how to decide between local installation types, perform upgrades, use automation techniques to deploy images and how to maintain Windows throughout the operational phase of the lifecycle.","details":{"authors":"Chris Rhodes, Andrew Bettany","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1484218264","isbn-13":"978-1484218266","pages":"189 pages","publication date":"October 13, 2016","publisher":"Apress","size":"8.00Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/0e/0e0d21f6501c0d2195d83c5fd6d8b92c.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/bd9","title":"Windows Installation and Update Troubleshooting"}
