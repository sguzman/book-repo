{"categories":["Computing","Engineering","Mobile Development","Networking","Sysadmin","Telecommunications"],"desc":" This Synthesis Lecture presents a discussion of Quality of Service (QoS) in wireless networks over unlicensed spectrum. The topic is presented from the point of view of protocols for wireless networks (e.g., 802.11) rather than the physical layer point of view usually discussed for cellular networks in the licensed wireless spectrum. A large number of mobile multimedia wireless applications are being deployed over WiFi (IEEE 802.11) and Bluetooth wireless networks and the number will increase in the future as more phones, tablets, and laptops are equipped with these unlicensed spectrum wireless interfaces.
