{"categories":["Web Development"],"desc":" This book walks the reader from a basic overview and introduction to jQuery with illustrations of how it works with a WordPress site and then starts building enhancements that start off very simply and increase in dynamics as the book progresses. You’ll start off with some simple CSS manipulation and move on to creating some sleek visual validation to your site’s forms and by the end of the book use the UI plugin seamlessly within WordPress and create a custom rotating slide-show and incorporate AJAX techniques to your site. All the while showing you how to create these enhancements without “breaking up the work-flow” of the WordPress content editors. This book is for anyone who is interested in using jQuery with a WordPress site. It’s assumed that most readers will be WordPress developers with a pretty good understanding of PHP or JavaScript programming and at the very least experienced with HTML/CSS development who want to learn how to quickly apply jQuery to their WordPress projects.","details":{"authors":"Blakeley Silver Tessa","format":"pdf","isbn-10":"1849511748","isbn-13":"978-1849511742","pages":"316 pages","publication date":"September 24, 2010","publisher":"Packt Publishing","size":"10.22Mb"},"img":"http://23.95.221.108/covers/cf/cfbbe0116af23856a5896b76a3593a4d.jpg","link":"https://rapidhosting.info/files/gls","title":"WordPress 3.0 jQuery"}
